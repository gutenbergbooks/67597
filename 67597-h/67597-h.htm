<p class="first">Having been for some time located in the border districts of the Cape Colony, and
there coming into frequent contact with the natives; I was struck with the fact that
there was a large field for investigation, and record of the “Medical Folk Lore” of
the Bantu tribes, which was becoming more and more difficult of attainment as time
went on, owing to the fact that the true unsophisticated native was rapidly becoming
a thing of the past; or if one may put it so, becoming contaminated by the advance
of civilization. Under the pressure of Colonial rule, Magistrates and Missionaries,
the native character and ways are changing. Breeks and petticoats are endowed with
positive virtues. They are made steps in the ladder that tends upwards, and the old
fashioned Kaffir is fast disappearing.
</p>
<p>Red clay and blankets or skins give way to veneer and varnish; outward conformity
to a kind of civilization knocks off some objectionable, and some quite unobjectionable
ways, and leaves the inside man as superstitious and as ignorant as ever.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb.viii">[<a href="#pb.viii">viii</a>]</span></p>
<p>The following pages are the result of an extensive study of the records available
on the subject, combined with much valuable information supplied to me chiefly by
educated Natives, Missionaries, and a large number of others, such as some of the
Cape Civil Servants, who had to deal with the aborigine in the early days of European
occupation of the country. To all of whom I wish to record my best thanks, more especially
to Mr. W. Hammond Tooke for the Chapter on the Bantu Nation; Mr. Andrew Smith, of
St. Cyrus, for assisting in gathering information, and for his valuable assistance
in the preparing of the Chapter on the Herb treatment of Disease; Mr. W.&nbsp;C. Scully,
of the Cape Civil Service; and to Mr. J. M’tombeni, Native Teacher, for gathering
and editing much valuable information from amongst the Kaffirs.
</p>
<p>I trust that the result here set forth, which they have assisted in producing, may
be of some value, and not wholly disappointing to them.

<h2 class="label">CHAPTER I.</h2>
<h2 class="main">BANTU TRIBES</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The Bantu race comprises one great family extending over all Central and South Africa,
South of a line drawn roughly from the Kamerun to the Pokomo River, but excluding
the South West corner—Great Namaqualand and Western Cape Colony—which from time immemorial
has been occupied by Hottentots.
</p>
<p>Although strictly speaking the term “Bantu” is philological, and this classification
based on linguistic grounds, and although the different tribes it embraces show largely
but in varying degrees that they result from a mixture with oriental or negro blood,
yet the similarity of speech, custom and religion, warrant our treating them collectively
as one homogenous ethnological group.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb2">[<a href="#pb2">2</a>]</span></p>
<p>It is now a generally received opinion that the Bantu originally emanated from a region
in the Congo basin, probably north of that river where it receives the tributary Mubangi,
and that the Europeans first met the Kaffirs as the vanguard of this invading army
when their long march southward to the furthest extremity of the Continent was nearly
completed.
</p>
<p>The Ova Herero when burying their dead place the corpse with the face turned towards
the north “to remind them whence they originally came,” and the bodies of the Bechuana
are made to face in the same direction. No such custom is recorded among the Zulu
or Kaffir but we have other evidence that the exodus southward of the tribes who fled
before the devastation of Tshaka was but the continuance of a migration from a more
northerly region.
</p>
<p>The testimony of the Arabian geographer of the tenth century El Masudi shows that
what we now call the Kaffir tribes had not at that time advanced south of Zanzibar,
the country of Zenj as it was then called. In the sixteenth century shipwrecked mariners
from Portuguese vessels thrown on the inhospitable coasts stretching from Cape Agulhas
to <span class="pageNum" id="pb3">[<a href="#pb3">3</a>]</span>Delagoa Bay found Kaffirs as far south and west as the Umtata River, but no further.
At the end of the seventeenth century however they were found by the Dutch beyond
the Great Fish River intermarrying with the Hottentots.
</p>
<p>The Ova Herero and Ovampo probably represent other branches of Bantu who took a more
<span class="corr" id="xd31e223" title="Source: westernly">westerly</span> direction, and the Bechuana formed, it is likely, a more recent wave of invasion,
in its turn moving southward but by a more central route.
</p>
<p>Whatever the cradle of their race, the Kaffirs are now located in the region situated
between the Great Fish River, the Kathlamba or Drakensberg mountains and their outlying
spurs and subsiding ranges; the northern boundaries of the Portuguese settlements
around Delagoa Bay, and the Indian Ocean. Those tribes most intimately connected with
the history of the Cape still occupy territory partly within the bounds of the Colony
proper—the divisions of Queenstown, Woodhouse Glen Grey, Cathcart, Stutterheim, Komgha,
King Williams Town, East London, Peddie, Victoria East and Fort Beaufort—and partly
in the region lying between the North Eastern <span class="pageNum" id="pb4">[<a href="#pb4">4</a>]</span>Frontier, Basutoland, Natal and the Ocean and known as the Transkeian territories
of Tembuland, Pondoland and East Griqualand. They are named as follows: Aba-Tembus
ama-Mpondo, ama-Mpondumise, ama-Ntinde, ama-Ngqika, (Gaika), ama-Ndhlambe and ama-Gcaleka.
The three last spring from one large tribe, the ama-Rarabe, and comprise with the
ama-Ntinde the “fighting ama-Xosa” of the Kaffir Wars. These are the tribes to which
Dr. Hewat’s researches more particularly refer. Their chiefs trace back their origin
to the common ancestor Zwide who lived about Cromwell’s time, perhaps earlier. There
are a few isolated and comparatively insignificant classes who have separated through
feuds and quarrels from the main tribes, or have mingled with the Hottentots by inter-marriage,
such as the ama-Qate (or ama-Xesibe), ama-Baca, and ama-Gqunuk­webe; and we must not
omit to mention the ama-Bele, ama-Zizi, and aba-Mbo classes who were formerly large
tribes occupying at one time Natal and perhaps Zululand and from whom are derived
the Fingoes of the Cape Colony—also referred to by Dr. Hewat—the Natal Kaffirs, the
Zulus, and the Matabele of Rhodesia.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb5">[<a href="#pb5">5</a>]</span></p>
<p>The aba-Xosa and aba-Tembu tribes with whom we first came into contact, the pioneers
of the Kaffir advance southward are supposed to show least modified and developed
the distinguishing characteristics of their race. Their lighter colour argues a slight
admixture of Hottentot blood and their intercourse with this race was doubtless considerable.
From it they have borrowed the clicks which distinguish their speech from other Bantu
dialects. In other respects their language is archaic and free from phonetic decay
compared with that of other tribes such as the <span class="corr" id="xd31e233" title="Source: Swaheli">Swahili</span>. Their pursuits were exclusively those of the hunter and herdsman, war and hunting
were their pastimes, cattle tending and cattle rearing the serious business of their
lives. Indeed cattle mainly constituted their wealth and everything connected therewith
was deemed of the highest importance. Herding and milking were privileged labours
jealously confined to the men, who also took much pride in training oxen for racing
purposes.
</p>
<p>It is not surprising to find therefore that their skill as veterinary surgeons was
considerable and quite equal to that which Dr. Hewat has shown they possess as medical
practitioners and surgeons.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb6">[<a href="#pb6">6</a>]</span></p>
<p>Maize or Indian corn [Zea mais, Kaffir “Umbilo”] which the Kaffir somewhat recently
used for food in addition to their milk and flesh diet and millet a Kaffir corn [Hotcus
sorghum “Mabele”] from which they still make “beer” were grown and consumed to a much
greater extent by the Fingoes.
</p>
<p>These refugees (ama-mfengu i.e. wanderers) remnants of the ama-Bele, ama-Zizi and
aba-Mbo who formerly occupied the territory now comprising Natal, from which they
were driven some seventy or eighty years ago by Tshaka show a much greater capacity
for agricultural pursuits. Besides growing extensive patches of mealies and millet
they cultivated pumpkins, and some of them the imphie, or wild sugar cane [H. Saccharatum.]
Moreover in addition to cattle and poultry they reared sheep and a small kind of goat.
A softer climate and soil more fruitful than are characteristic of Kaffraria south
of the Kei River most likely induced these classes to resort to avocations more agricultural
than those of the savage Xosa and Tembu tribes.
</p>
<p>There is one tribe mentioned by Dr. Hewat to which I have not yet referred, and that
is the Basuto.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb7">[<a href="#pb7">7</a>]</span></p>
<p>The Basuto speak a dialect so distinct from that of the Kaffir that individuals of
these tribes have as much difficulty in understanding each other as a Dutchman would
have in understanding a German. They are a branch of the Bechuana group of Bantu which
comprises the Barotse, Bamangwato, Batlapin, Barolong and other tribes. Unlike most
of these which are tribes of pure descent ruled by a succession of hereditary chiefs
the Basuto is composed of fragments of many <span class="corr" id="xd31e247" title="Source: furgitive">fugitive</span> peoples who escaped from the armies of Tshaka and Unsilikazi (Moselekatze) and had
taken refuge in the mountainous regions of the Drakensberg and Maluti, and were welded
together into a nation by Moshesh. This chief like Romulus of old created a sanctuary
for all outcasts and broken men and by the judicious use of war and diplomacy not
only preserved an independence against the threats and attacks of neighbouring tribes
but dexterously held his own against both Boer and British. By his astute rule for
which since his death British control has gradually been substituted, a country which
was once a mere colluvies gentium is now as compared with other native territories
a well ordered state, the home of a homogeneous <span class="pageNum" id="pb8">[<a href="#pb8">8</a>]</span>population forward in the arts of peace and formidable in war.
</p>
<p>The slopes of the Maluti and the basin of the Caledon are depastured by cattle or
covered with wheat or other grain owned by a peasantry each member of which is a good
customer to the Colonial trader and possesses his pony<span class="corr" id="xd31e254" title="Not in source">,</span> his saddle and his rifle.
</p>
<p>One must not however jump to the conclusion that the average Mosuto has raised himself
in intellectual capacity or freedom from sensualism and superstition far above the
other Bantu tribes. Good government has however so improved his material condition
and raised his standard of comfort that it may at least be said that the seeds of
<span class="corr" id="xd31e258" title="Source: civilisation">civilization</span> are sown on favourable soil.
</p>
<p><i>I am indebted to Mr W. Hammond Tooke, of the Cape Civil Service, for the foregoing
facts relating to the ethnology of the “Bantu Tribes.”</i>

<h2 class="label">CHAPTER II.</h2>
<h2 class="main">SOME OBSERVATIONS OF INTEREST IN THE FOLK LORE OF THE KAFFIR.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Before proceeding to enumerate and describe the diseases, as recognised by the natives,
their cures and what the Kaffir believes to be their causes, there are several subjects
that are of interest in the study of Kaffir Folk Lore which I propose shortly to notice.
</p>
<p>The Kaffirs, would be a healthy, long lived people were it not for the excesses of
riot they run, in the practice of adultery, drinking, dancing, etc. Their mode of
living on simple mixed diet, and practically entirely in the open air, in a fine climate
is exceeding favourable to robust health and longevity and perhaps no nation enjoys,
on the whole, better health.
</p>
<p>When disease does occur in man or animal it is almost invariably ascribed by the Kaffir
to <span class="pageNum" id="pb10">[<a href="#pb10">10</a>]</span>the agency of human beings, either a living person or as often as not some departed
relation who has used witchcraft or “Umtagati.”
</p>
<p>Even the vast majority of Mission or school natives who are more or less educated,
retain this belief, so deep is it rooted in the native mind, in spite of the fact
that Missionaries have preached against it for years.
</p>
<p>Throughout South Africa the practice of witchcraft is a criminal offence and severely
punished; nevertheless the belief remains, and witchcraft, and “Smelling out” are
carried out in secrecy. Many hut burnings and solitary murders being undoubtedly traceable
to this practice.
</p>
<p>It is a well recognised fact amongst those living in the Native Territories that of
all the deaths amongst cattle that have taken place there in the recent epidemic of
Rinderpest probably nineteen out of twenty have been ascribed to witchcraft.
</p>
<p>From the foregoing it will be seen that it is, to the Kaffir, possible that <i>anyone may attain power over disease</i> and inflict a fellow being, usually by calling in the assistance of the Ghosts of
the departed, or of natural spirits or <span class="pageNum" id="pb11">[<a href="#pb11">11</a>]</span>demons. It will be observed when studying the methods of curing disease that many
of the cures are for the purpose of driving out the bewitching spirit. Just as in
the ancient folklore of England offensive drugs were administered etc. for this purpose
so it is at the present day in native practice.
</p>
<p>The Natives believe that several agencies are often the chief cause of disease and
have much power over the sick person.
</p>
<p>The chief of these are. 1. Icanti. Uhili or Tikoloshe and Im-pundulu. 2. Im-paka.
3. U-buti (poison).
</p>
<p>1. Icanti. U-hili or Tikoloshe and Im-pundulu. These three bodies are combined in
their action and any person possessed of any one of them must needs be possessed of
all three. They are however three distinct bodies<span class="corr" id="xd31e289" title="Not in source">.</span>
</p>
<p>They are often used by women and in many instances in order to secure the affection
of someone of the opposite sex or of their families.
</p>
<p>(a). Incanti in its natural state is a rare water snake which is believed to have
the power of changing its colour or assuming various forms resembling different objects
and has great powers of fascination.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb12">[<a href="#pb12">12</a>]</span></p>
<p>Any one who comes upon an Icanti suddenly remains motionless and speechless.
</p>
<p>This snake can be preserved in various ways, and is secretly kept by some woman who
hands it down to her daughters and they to their female <span class="corr" id="xd31e298" title="Source: decendants">descendants</span> so that disease occuring in a tribe and to which certain families are liable (hereditary
disease) is ascribed to the influence of the Icanti, always be it understood with
the assistance of his co-workers, the Tikoloshe and Im-pundulu.
</p>
<p>(b). U-hili or Tikoloshe. A short stumpy creature living in water, half man, half
animal. The Kaffir has a special belief, attached to this U-hili; thus if a woman
be fond of her husband and children, she is credited with having been tempted by the
Tikoloshe and having resisted his importunities.
</p>
<p>(c). Im-pundulu, is supposed to be a bird which can assume the appearance of a man.
This bird has besides the power of bringing disease, that of bringing down lighting.
</p>
<p>It will thus be seen that the Native recognises hereditary disease, and he believes
that the triple association of these three I’canti, Tikoloshe and Im-pundulu is the
chief cause of this hereditary disease in a family, being handed down from mother
to daughter. Of <span class="pageNum" id="pb13">[<a href="#pb13">13</a>]</span>course it is understood that these agencies are engaged or induced to act by some
enemy or some outraged spirit of a departed ancestor.
</p>
<p>2. <i>Im-paka<span class="corr" id="xd31e311" title="Not in source">.</span></i> This is a creature resembling a cat, which has the power of getting inside any hut
and by scratching the body of a person of inoculating him with poison. The Im-paka
is bred by wizards and set on by them to spread or give disease.
</p>
<p>This is a superstition that exists mostly amongst the Fingoes.
</p>
<p>3. <i>Ubuti.</i> (Poison). The usual methods of putting poison in food or drink is here considered
the cause<span class="corr" id="xd31e318" title="Source: ,">.</span> This Ubuti may be used by living people or by the usual and ever present “spirits.”
</p>
<p>Other things which are believed to cause disease are:—
</p>
<p>4. <i>In-Qumbabane.</i> This is a wand like snake which is believed to be the chief cause of fevers. By getting
inside a person it eats up the inside of the man and so causes his death. Speaking
generally as in old English lore the methods adopted to get rid of this <span class="corr" id="xd31e327" title="Source: In-quambabane">In-Qumbabane</span> are aimed at making the host an unpleasant abode for it and thus evil smelling <span class="pageNum" id="pb14">[<a href="#pb14">14</a>]</span>herb are rubbed on the orifices of the body and bitter nauseating drugs swallowed.
</p>
<p>5. <i>Mamlambo.</i> This is another snake chiefly known by Zulus and used by them as a charm. If not
properly used it causes sickness or death, and has come to be looked on as a possible
cause of sickness in many cases.
</p>
<p>6. Omitting to observe certain ceremonies or rites is supposed to cause umbrage to
the spirits and thus, bring about illness. Thus if the finger of a new born infant
is not cut, the infant will be sickly and die young.
</p>
<p>If “circumcision” in man or “Intonjane” in woman is omitted the Imishologu (spirits
of the dead) are dissatisfied and disease or barren-results.
</p>
<p>7. <i>Etc.</i> Certain superstitions are attached by the Kaffir to a number of things or practices;
for example.—Heaps of stones, which they call “Isivivane,” a stone lifted from the
path and placed on the branch of a tree; a heap of small dry sticks placed by the
road-side; tying the long grass by the wayside into knots; chewing certain leaves,
roots, or barks, of certain plants; or wearing these last; crossing certain streams,
especially in the case of women or children; washing in or drinking of certain pools
or streams; dogs howling at <span class="pageNum" id="pb15">[<a href="#pb15">15</a>]</span>night; owls hooting as if from the top of cattle or hut etc.
</p>
<p>They also have superstitions about the bird “Broomvogel” or “Intsikizi” e.g<span class="corr" id="xd31e346" title="Not in source">.</span>: it is terribly unlucky to kill one; about a cow or ox entering a hut or a calf lying
down when its mother is being milked; about the killing of the Umntani­zulu or mantis,
the insect called the “<span class="corr" id="xd31e348" title="Source: Hotentots">Hottentots</span> God” by the Boers. And many other things or acts of like nature into the description
of which it would be foreign to the present subject to enter.
</p>
<p>The following superstition and practice with reference to the dead existed in the
early times, though it is seldom heard of now. When the head of a family died without
saying where he was going e.g. suddenly; immediately after his expiring the sons or
daughters were compelled to place a piece of old leather or some similar thing between
his teeth or into his mouth to show that he had died unhappily, in consequence of
being bewitched. This had the effect of bringing all his acquaintances under suspicion
of having bewitched him and the general public were in great danger of being accused
by the “Isanusi” of <span class="corr" id="xd31e353" title="Source: witchraft">witchcraft</span>. The death of such an one is at once reported at the <span class="pageNum" id="pb16">[<a href="#pb16">16</a>]</span>“great place” and the chief despatches a number of men to the kraal to seize and confiscate
all his property and cattle.
</p>
<p>The belief is that a person dying under these circumstances had gone to a place of
punishment; but the Amaxosa have no name for it. They, have, however a name for a
happy place although they cannot describe it.
</p>
<p>The superstitious idea attached to the death above referred to, is that the soul of
the dead man, being dissatisfied is likely to inspire his children or near relatives
with a spirit of witchcraft and that they are likely to become a public danger in
consequence.
</p>
<p>These relatives are therefore forever looked upon with suspicion, and are frequently
“smelled out” as the cause of bewitching in subsequent events. They are often severely
tortured, sometimes fatally, in order to get them to confess their sins. One of the
chief methods of torture is to tie them inside the hut while it is kept filled with
dense pungent smoke.
</p>
<p><i>Superstition</i> pervades the whole of the Bantu family. They all believe in the spirit world and
the resurrection from the dead even of the lower animals.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb17">[<a href="#pb17">17</a>]</span></p>
<p>They believe that a new state of things is going to be, only in a different way from
that generally understood by certain christian nations. It will be remembered that
at the great “Cattle Killing Craze” of the Kaffirs, they believed, as told by their
seer, that their ancestors would all come back on a certain day and help them to drive
the white people into the sea. So that they would again come to inherit the land.
</p>
<p><i>Sacrifices.</i> “Idini” are offered by the “Medicine man” to appease the wrath of the offended spirits
of ancestors, who are supposed to have caused the sickness of a patient or some such
calamity. It being thought that they can by thus appealing to the pleasure of the
“imi-Nyanga” (ghosts), buy them off or secure future immunity.
</p>
<p>The following circumstances are instances of cases demanding sacrifices: e.g.
</p>
<p>1. Should anyone dream about his ancestors who are dead; that was taken as an indication,
that they were displeased at some neglect and demanded an “Idini.”
</p>
<p>2. Should there be illness either of man or beast, and a doctor (Isanuse) be called
in and <span class="pageNum" id="pb18">[<a href="#pb18">18</a>]</span>declare, “I see your ancestors. They are angry because you have not rendered them
their due”; it was understood that an “Idini” was required.
</p>
<p>3. Should there be a scarcity of rain, the people would go to the chief and say, “Why
do you allow this drought to go on? Why do you not approach your ancestors”; when
a great sacrifice would be offered.
</p>
<p>The most common method of offering a sacrifice is the following:—
</p>
<p>Fuel is first prepared, consisting of chips of “Sneezewood,” a very hard, slow burning
wood.
</p>
<p>An ox is slaughtered in the centre of the cattlefold in the afternoon, and the blood
carried over to the hut of the person, who requires the sacrifice. Who, for instance,
has dreamt about his ancestors or whose relative is ill, etc., and deposited in a
Kaffir basket (these baskets are watertight) at the back of the hut. In carrying it,
drops are purposely allowed to fall on the way, as a guide to the spirits from the
hut to the Kaffir kraal, where on the morrow the ceremony is to be performed. The
rest of the carcase is carried in sections to the hut, and piled up in the centre
on sneezewood and laurel twigs.
</p>
<p>Next day a fire is made of sneezewood on the <span class="pageNum" id="pb19">[<a href="#pb19">19</a>]</span>spot of slaughter i.e. the centre of the cattle fold and, with the exception of the
women’s portion, (the inferior pieces) the meat is brought to the fire where it is
roasted or boiled and around which it is eaten; the internal fat around kidneys, etc.,
“in-thukuhla” being given to the “imi-Nyanga<span class="corr" id="xd31e384" title="Not in source">”</span> (ghosts) before the general cooking commences.
</p>
<p>The whole of the animal is consumed that day. It is simply astonishing what an enormous
quantity of meat can be consumed by a Kaffir on these occasions.
</p>
<p>Frequently there is a great deal of Kaffir beer, (an intoxicating beverage brewed
by the natives from Kaffir corn), consumed at these functions, and as a consequence
much debauchery, often ending in bloodshed occurs.
</p>
<p>At these sacrifices the women have their own little demonstration with the children
at the calves’-fold.
</p>
<p>In the case of sacrifices by chiefs on great occasions, carcases are sometimes wholly
burned.
</p>
<p><i>Amulets and Charms<span id="xd31e394"></span></i> are often worn by the natives, such as:—
</p>
<p>1. Necklace of the long hairs of a cow’s tail plaited together. The cow furnishing
the hairs <span class="pageNum" id="pb20">[<a href="#pb20">20</a>]</span>is held sacred and never killed or sold.
</p>
<p>2. Seeds of the rhiza to keep away convulsions, worn by infants.
</p>
<p>3. Pieces of “mooti,” medicinal wood, to keep away disease generally.
</p>
<p>4. Leopard’s tooth to make him brave, &amp;c., &amp;c., and such things as love philtres are
not unknown to the Kaffir beaux, in spite of the lobolo, or purchase system of getting
a wife.
</p>
<p>The <i>Drugs that comprise the Native Pharmacopœia</i> are very numerous and varied, and are dealt with and used as described in subsequent
pages. Speaking generally, they are derived mostly from natural products. The vegetable
kingdom supplies the greatest part in the form of roots, bark, wood, leaves, juice,
flowers and fruit prepared in various ways and used as powders, infusions, extracts,
and applications. Medicated baths are much used by some Kaffir specialists.
</p>
<p>Those for internal use are most commonly purgatives or emetics, and for external use
<span class="corr" id="xd31e409" title="Source: vescicants">vesicants</span> or irritants according to the degree of dilution or mode of application.
</p>
<p>The animal kingdom also supplies some remedies, <i>e.g.</i>, The skin of a python, powdered, used for soothing; Hide of Alligator; Ox Gall; <span class="pageNum" id="pb21">[<a href="#pb21">21</a>]</span>Snake venom with gall. Cantharides beetle (Mylabris), a severe irritant which has
caused death in several known instances when administered too freely internally.
</p>
<p>Minerals are little used by the natives (although now-a-days Paraffine is a great
favourite).
</p>
<p>The more valuable remedies have been used by the Herb doctors for ages, and a knowledge
of their properties transmitted from one to another, so that there is a considerable
heritage of experience to justify their use.
</p>
<p>We often find the same herb, perhaps under a different name used by the Gaikas, Gcalekas,
Fingoes, Tembus, &amp;c., for the same malady; conclusive proof of the efficacy and ancient
origin of its use.
</p>
<p>As the maxim of “No cure, no pay” is accepted by both doctor and patient, worthless
remedies are sifted out, and the high fee often paid for a cure tends in the same
direction.
</p>
<p>The Materia Medica of the Kaffir is apparently collected at any time, and they observe
no ceremonies in collecting it, nor do they take <span class="pageNum" id="pb22">[<a href="#pb22">22</a>]</span>note of the seasons, moon phases, &amp;c., in so doing.
</p>
<p>In contrast to what one finds in the Folk Lore of other savage races, the Kaffir tribes
appear to take very little heed to the phases of the elements<span class="corr" id="xd31e429" title="Not in source">.</span> They have no astronomical knowledge and except in some few authentic cases of eclipse
of sun or moon, carry out their daily life uninfluenced by sun, star, or moon.
</p>
<p>Perhaps the only seasonal practice known is the habit of the Fingoes in early spring,
of taking an emetic, often very strong and lowering the system.
</p>
<p><i>The King is the chief Doctor</i>, but with this exception anyone may become a medicine man or woman.
</p>
<p><i>Domestic remedies</i> are much used amongst the commonality, but such things as <i>appeals to saints or deities</i> do not take place, for the Kaffir has no saint or deity.
</p>
<p>Few <i>Surgical Instruments</i> are used. Knives and needles for scarifying: a cupping glass of cowshorn about 6
or 8 inches long are about the only instruments used.
</p>
<p>The cupping glass is used thus. The skin is <span class="pageNum" id="pb23">[<a href="#pb23">23</a>]</span>scarified by needles and the larger end of the horn placed over the wounds. Suction
by the mouth is then exerted at the smaller end through which a small hole has been
bored.
</p>
<p>It is the practice of the natives to <i>attend their sick at home</i> and except in known infectious cases <i>e.g.</i> Small pox, amaas, &amp;c., they are certainly not avoided in any way: quite the contrary,
many visits are paid by sympathising friends and much assistance offered by them.
</p>
<p><i>Incurables</i> are usually looked on as pensioners of the kraal and charitably treated.
</p>
<p><i>Deformed infants</i>, that is, those born deformed, are generally got rid of by order of the chief: usually
by leaving them in the open at night when carnivora make short shrift of them. In
addition, there are several minor abnormalities that are looked upon as evidence of
the child being a witch child, and rendering it likely to be got rid of in a similar
way or even openly destroyed. Such conditions for instance, as hare lip, obvious squints,
born with teeth, arrival of the upper incisors before the lower, are looked upon with
grave suspicion.
</p>
<p>In case of a <i>death</i> taking place, the hut is <span class="pageNum" id="pb24">[<a href="#pb24">24</a>]</span>burned down, and the spot whereon it stood obliterated as much as possible: it being
considered bewitched and avoided in consequence.
</p>
<p>At the <i>graveside</i>, for the Bantus bury their dead, much ceremony is observed, and the relations leave
offerings for the dead saying, “Look on us favourably where you are going.” They believe
in a vague sort of way in a future existence, and that the spirits of the departed
have some sort of continuous existence and power over the lives of the living usually
exercised for ill. For this reason many ceremonies are observed, which it is foreign
to the intention of this essay to describe in detail, in order to secure that the
departed spirit will rest in peace and not give future trouble.

<h2 class="label">CHAPTER III.</h2>
<h2 class="main">DOCTORS (AMAGQIRA).</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The Kaffirs have great faith in the power of their “Medicine man” and consult him
on every possible event. They requisition his services for sickness and pain, and
accident, foretelling and causing the fall of rain; as detectives to find stolen or
strayed or lost property; to point out criminals and bewitchers; to steer them clear
of <span class="corr" id="xd31e478" title="Source: witchcrift">witchcraft</span>, to make them brave in war; to secure their departed spirits rest; and so on almost
“ad infinitum.”
</p>
<p>One day talking to a Fingo headman, a Wesleyan preacher, over the case of a sick Fingo
woman, and arguing that, after all the District Surgeon should be trusted to know
best what to do, as he had had years of study so as to recognise and treat disease.
I was met by this reason for his preferring his native doctor, “Oh yes but you see
our native doctors are taught by God.”
<span class="pageNum" id="pb26">[<a href="#pb26">26</a>]</span></p>
<p>The “Medicine man” is in all ordinary cases openly called in; but in cases where witchcraft
is suspected he is (owing to such an accusation and its consequences being now-a-days
criminal), called by stealth and works in secrecy. He is paid a retaining fee and
a good one if successful.
</p>
<p>Speaking generally his powers are quite unlimited; although in many instances, some
particular Medico will specialize and become famous for some one or group of diseases,
his patients often coming great distances to consult him or her as the case may be,
for sex makes, except in a few cases, no difference.
</p>
<p>As a general rule some form of <i>Incantation</i> is used to exorcise the demon of disease, and if the doctor attributes the illness
to the work of some departed spirit, sacrifices are offered to appease his wrath.
</p>
<p>As one gathers more and more information on the Medicine Man, and medicine practices
of the natives, one is struck with the conviction, that, as pointed out by Herbert
Spencer, the “Medicine man” as such, is a natural evolution from the priest, and he
is a natural sequence to a belief in ghosts and the continuous existence and influence
for good or evil of the souls, <span class="pageNum" id="pb27">[<a href="#pb27">27</a>]</span>spirits, ghosts or something else of dead ancestors.
</p>
<p>As one would expect there is a gradual evolution amongst the natives of the Bantu
tribes, from the Priest, pure and simple, to the “Medicine man” proper; one who leaves
the supernatural out of his method of treatment and depends on nature and combination
of nature’s products for the cure of disease. Thus we have the “Isanuse,” the witch
doctor, diviner of secrets, etc., and on the other hand the “Igquira Elemicisa,” the
herb doctor; some of these latter even going the length of specializing different
classes of diseases; and the “Awamatambo,” Kaffir Surgeons.
</p>
<p>The Kaffir <i>Doctor</i> may be of either sex, except in the case of the war doctor, who is always a male;
and in the puberty rites of (intonyana) and (ubukweta), each sex is treated by a practitioner
of like sex.
</p>
<p>Some of these “doctors” inherit, or are taught the knowledge possessed by their father
or mother, <i>e.g.</i>, the Awemiciza; others become so by voluntary submission to rites and training, vide
Isanusi, where the process of Ukutwasa is described. They all carry on their person
charms <span class="pageNum" id="pb28">[<a href="#pb28">28</a>]</span>of numerous kinds; dried lizards, tiger’s teeth, fish bones, etc., etc., etc., that
have for them special virtues; and the large majority claim to have power over the
demons of disease; for to the unsophisticated Kaffir, all disease is caused by “Umtagati”
or witchcraft, and although the doctor may rely on his herbs and treatment to cure
his patient, he is led to practice spells and go through incantations to meet the
evident expectations of his patients, and perhaps more so of the relatives.
</p>
<p>Taking a “Herb Doctor” all-round he is often a clever fellow, good at the cure of
some diseases, and his methods and principles compare favourably with those ascribed
to Aesculapius and Galen in the early history of medicine.
</p>
<p>The Kaffir uses a pronominal prefixual polysyllabic language, and attention to the
structure of Kaffir words is necessary in order to understand the terms applied to
the various kinds of Kaffir doctors.
</p>
<p>“Isanuse” is a substantive term of unknown origin, meaning a witch finder or witch
doctor.
</p>
<p>Most of the other names consist of two parts<span class="pageNum" id="pb29">[<a href="#pb29">29</a>]</span>—a distinguishing part preceded by Igqira, which means “doctor,” just as we use the
term Doctor of Herbs, the Kaffir uses that of

<h3 class="main"><span class="divNum"><i>A.</i></span> The Witch Doctors.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">1. <i>The Isanuse</i> (Umgoma of the Zulus) is a witch doctor, who professes to have direct intercourse
with the spirit world, and practices divination, or in his language, “Ukunuka” or
“smelling out.” Their assistance and influence is employed in “smelling out<span class="corr" id="xd31e664" title="Not in source">”</span> sorcerers or bewitchers, “Amagqira” or “Abatakati,” and although they are forbidden
to practice in the <span class="pageNum" id="pb31">[<a href="#pb31">31</a>]</span>Cape Colony or Natal under heavy penalties if discovered, they practice secretly and
do much harm; mysterious burnings of Kraals, etc., taking place after the departure
of one of these gentry. Until recently they practiced unrestrained in Zululand and
Pondoland, and exercised a truly awful power for evil; hundreds and even thousands
having been “smelled out” and put to death within recent times.
</p>
<p>Probably no more <span class="corr" id="xd31e670" title="Source: villanous">villainous</span> and unmitigated fraud than the Kaffir “Isanuse” exists on the face of the earth.
Pretending to possess the faculty of divination, he trains his memory and powers of
observation to an extraordinary degree. Every little circumstance coming within his
cognisance is hoarded up for future use. Nothing is too trivial, and by the assistance
of spies he is kept informed of everything that goes on in his clan or tribe. Rich
and influential men are, of course, the special objects of his keenest regard.
</p>
<p>Nothing is unimportant, and such things as the pattern of a snuffbox, a dent in an
assegai handle or blade, the number and etc., of shells worn in a necklet or charm,
are noted for possible use against the owner, should it be advisable to convict him
of Sorcery.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb32">[<a href="#pb32">32</a>]</span></p>
<p>Scully thus describes an hypothetical case.
</p>
<p>Let us suppose that a child is ill, and the friends have decided to consult their
Isanuse, and find out who has bewitched him, for, to the Kaffir, sickness is always
due to witchcraft or “Umtagati.” A present of a goat or ox or something else is brought,
depending on the wealth of the individual and the importance of the Isanuse. The friends
sit down in front of the Isanuse’s hut, when he, being previously warned of their
coming and its object, comes forth and tells them to “Vuma” or acknowledge what he
says to be the truth. After a time of consideration he will say, “You have come to
find out who has bewitched the child of <span class="corr" id="xd31e679" title="Source: “">‘</span>Sogolima.<span class="corr" id="xd31e682" title="Not in source">’</span>” All clap their hands and shout “Vuma” “Siyavuma,” we acknowledge.
</p>
<p>If a false statement is made, the clapping and shouting is involuntarily not so emphatic,
when he will say<span class="corr" id="xd31e686" title="Source: .">,</span> “No you lie, it is not so and so,” when loud shouts of “Siyavuma, Siyavuma mhloko<span id="xd31e689"></span>! Siyavuma!!!<span class="corr" id="xd31e691" title="Not in source">”</span> and clapping of hands will show how his hearers admire his wonderful powers.
</p>
<p>The next stage is to say who has been the bewitcher. He points at the individual whom
he has decided to incriminate saying, “you <span class="pageNum" id="pb33">[<a href="#pb33">33</a>]</span>took the assegai with the crack in the handle which you mended with a thong of goat
hide in the spring last year, and digging in front of the hut of the sick person,
buried something (previously and in secret placed there by the Isanuse), by which
you bewitched the child.<span class="corr" id="xd31e697" title="Not in source">”</span> This knowledge of details fills the spectators with dread and wonder at the powers
of the “doctor” and convinces his friends, who know that he has an assegai, so mended,
of his guilt. The subsequent finding of the buried charm drives away all further doubt
from their minds.
</p>
<p>The accused is then dealt with, by heavy fines or physical torture or even death.
</p>
<p>No doubt these individuals come in time, to believe that they actually possess magical
powers; and certainly it must be allowed that their faculties are often wonderfully
trained, with at times startling results, at least startling to the uninitiated.
</p>
<p>Usually the Isanuse takes his cue from the Chief as to whom he may accuse; but not
always; and is of course amenable to bribery from other sources.
</p>
<p>Women practice this horrible form of “doctoring” more than men.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb34">[<a href="#pb34">34</a>]</span></p>
<p><i>Scully</i> from whom I have obtained much information tells how an aged and rich Pondo becoming
a convert to christianity became a suspect, was accused at a smelling out, of treachery
to his chief and was hunted down and murdered while fleeing for sanctuary at a Mission
Station, within sight of the missionary, who was powerless to interfere.
</p>
<p>Mission Stations were respected and acknowledged as “Sanctuary” for people smelt out,
but they dared never return to their kraals.
</p>
<p>The following description, culled from the same <span class="corr" id="xd31e712" title="Source: cource">source</span>, of the ordinary course of action in the event of illness admirably describes what
may well have taken place.
</p>
<p>A fine baby is born. His proud mother fastens round his neck the seeds of the “Rhiza”
to keep away convulsions, a piece of “Mooti” or medicinal wood to prevent illness
generally. The father gave a Leopard’s tooth to hang on, “to make him brave.<span class="corr" id="xd31e717" title="Not in source">”</span>
</p>
<p>He takes measels, followed by chronic cough and wasting “Phtisis.” An “Isanuse” is
consulted as above described. He decides on the illness and advises a certain Gqira.
This Gqira (Native doctor) is sent for and a goat killed for his entertainment. He
doses the little patient <span class="pageNum" id="pb35">[<a href="#pb35">35</a>]</span>with infusion of various herbs, frog’s feet, baboon’s hair, lizard’s tails and other
items of his grotesque pharmacopœia. He then hangs some infallible charms, tied up
in the inevitable bag round the child’s neck and departs next morning with an ox or
other good fee, promising certain cure: Result nil.
</p>
<p>Another “Gqira” a most celebrated practitioner is sent for. This one requires a fat
black ox to be killed. With the blood of this animal he freely sprinkles all the members
of the family, the little patient getting an extra share. After speaking in most slighting
terms of the other doctor’s treatment, he makes a powder of burnt bones of several
kinds of snakes and birds, then, making small incisions with a sharp stick across
the chest and round the neck, arms and legs of the patient, he rubs the powder well
into them. After this he applies a plaster of fresh cowdung to the sick child’s chest,
and wrapping him up in the skin of the black ox killed on the previous evening, he
carries him out of the hut and lays him in the middle of the cattle kraal. It is now
noon and until sundown the “Gqira” dances and chants around his patient in the most
grotesque and frantic manner conceivable.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb36">[<a href="#pb36">36</a>]</span></p>
<p>Just at sundown, he falls down in a swoon or fit, foaming at the mouth and yelling
horribly, presently he comes to, and crawling over to where the poor little child
is looking on with horrified eyes from the wraps, he inserts his hands amongst the
folds of the skin and extracts a lizard about 4 in. in length, and holds it up to
the gaze of the admiring and applauding crowd. Here was the cause of the malady, rid
of which the child will at once mend! The mother weeps tears of joy as she loosens
the child from its unsavoury durance.
</p>
<p>The “Gqira” leaves next morning having established his reputation; taking as fees
two of the best cattle. Result nil.
</p>
<p>As the child got worse, the mother becomes convinced that someone has bewitched him,
and goes to consult one of the wizards or witch doctors “Awamatambo,” who is believed
to be able to foretell the future and reveal the secrets of the past, by the method
known as throwing the “Indawuli” (Dutch, dolossi bones). These are the metatarsal
or metacarpal bones of sheep and antelopes variously coloured. They are thrown, about
a dozen, like dice; and the “Gqira” studies them and reads the answer.
</p>
<p>His procedure is something thus:—Having <span class="pageNum" id="pb37">[<a href="#pb37">37</a>]</span>been paid his fee, a goat or something, he sits down with his kaross, throws the “Indawuli”
and then proceeds.
</p>
<p>First he recapitulates the disease and details of treatment that have been adopted,
and then accuses someone of witchcraft, someone whom he has a spite against or whom
he knows to be suspected. Says the child was charmed by the individual by means of
magic medicines which he had burned, which drew the lizard and toad and snake, “Uhili,
Icanti and Impundulu” to the mother’s hut and then the child sickened. He predicts
his certain death: a self evident fact by this time and which soon takes place, resulting
in much trouble in the king’s household and often bloodshed.
</p>
<p>The story is told of a great witch doctor being called to cure a girl of Epilepsy,
which was supposed to be “Umdhlemyana,” sickness caused by the casting of a love spell
by a young man in the neighbourhood; also of an instance where a child accidently
buried in a landslip alive, and heard crying is allowed to die unreleased, while witch
doctors have cattle and then goats driven over the place to appease the “Imishologu”
in whose custody the child was.
</p>
<p>There is another form of “smelling out,” <span class="pageNum" id="pb38">[<a href="#pb38">38</a>]</span>a more fearful affair the “Umhlalho,” or in Zulu “Ingoboko.” This is a tribal affair,
and is carried out in the following manner:
</p>
<p>The chief agrees to the summoning of a great “Umhlalho,” a great public dance, to
which selected tribes are invited, and must attend. The “Gqira,” the tribes being
assembled, after various incantations and probably working himself or herself (for
females often take to this profession) into a frenzy, will single out an individual,
or even at times a whole tribe as a guilty party, by throwing ashes over them. This
act being called “Ukunuka.” These parties may have been guilty of, say, causing sickness
in the king’s household, making one of his wives miscarry, or, in the case of a tribe,
having assisted in the escape of a fugitive.
</p>
<p>Those proclaimed guilty at an “Umhlalho” by means of the “Ukunuka” (throwing ashes),
the signs of being “smelled out,” are often summarily slaughtered or at least severely
punished, often with horrible tortures.
</p>
<p>It was an “Isanusi” called “Malakaza,” who was responsible, under the direction of
Kreli, for the great “Cattle Slaughter of the Kaffirs in 1856,” by which, according
to the Hon. Charles Brownlee, an undoubted <span class="corr" id="xd31e744" title="Source: authorithy">authority</span>, it is computed <span class="pageNum" id="pb39">[<a href="#pb39">39</a>]</span>that over 20,000 natives died of starvation and other diseases, and 30,000 were forced
to seek relief in the Cape Colony.
</p>
<p>An “Insanuse” goes through a regular course of initiation and education after the
following methods:—
</p>
<p>He or she gets an inspiration or has a dream in which he is called to visit a river,
near a deep and quiet pool, alone. He is said to be called by the spirit king of the
river, or the “Ingwenya,” or alligator, with a view to his destruction. He is, however,
protected by his guardian spirits, “Iminyanga.” While he is at the river he is instructed
by the “Ihili,” a sort of fairy who also guards his interests. He begins to see visions,
and is supposed to have some intercourse with spirits. In this stage of his initiation,
or as it is called “Ukutwasa,” he is known as “Elemishologu,” <span class="corr" id="xd31e752" title="Source: analagous">analogous</span> to the condition of a medical student. He, however, does some practising on his own
account even now.
</p>
<p>Later he pays in kind or in service, a superior or full fledged doctor to complete
his education; this stage being called “Uku penleleliva,” and eventually becomes a
full fledged member of one or other or perhaps several of the numerous <span class="pageNum" id="pb40">[<a href="#pb40">40</a>]</span>classes of native doctors or “Amagqira” (singular, <span class="corr" id="xd31e759" title="Not in source">“</span>Igqira”).
</p>
<p>The fees paid to these “Amagqira” vary considerably. They usually take the form of
cattle or other live stock or agricultural produce, and seem to depend on the case
and the wealth of the individual seeking assistance.
</p>
<p>The general plan is to pay fees as follows:—
</p>
<p>1. A small fee, about 5s., to get him to speak.
</p>
<p>2. The after payment to a regular practitioner is “Umkonto,” a visiting fee for diagnosing
the disease or advising a specialist.
</p>
<p>3. “Umlandu.” Fee for actual attendance, generally an animal, large or small; only
given if the treatment proves successful.
</p>
<p>A truly excellent method of remuneration, and which might be followed in more civilized
communities.
</p>
<p>This “Insanuse” is therefore a sage or diviner, who treats all kinds of disease, often
by charms and incantations, calculated to drive out the evil spirits (for to him all
disease is caused by “Umtagati,” or witchcraft), and frequently by the use of herbs
and drugs. He does not practice surgery.

<p>This is a spirit doctor, one who professes to see and be guided by spirits. He is
really the (medical) student stage of the “Inanuse,” and has gone through the initiation
“Ukutwasa,” only. He has still to pass his “Uku Penleleliva” to become an “Isanuse.”

<p>A 3. Igqira Eliligogo (e-la-igogo—who is “Igogo?” <i>i.e.</i>, and observer. Plural—“Ama-gogo”).
</p>
<p>“Igogo,” is a native name for a sort of antelope, which usually, when seen, is gazing
or observing.
</p>
<p>The title is applied to an individual, who foresees or foretells coming events. Some
of them, from continued observations, are very able in estimating chances or judging
of future <span class="pageNum" id="pb42">[<a href="#pb42">42</a>]</span>events by present and past facts, and so come to have quite a reputation as seers.
They will be asked such things as: “Will the rains be early, late or severe? Will
the crops suffer from hailstorms? Is an enemy to be expected, when and from where?”
They pretend to be told by dreams and visions that which they reveal, and some of
them go through forms of incantations, <i>e.g.<span class="corr" id="xd31e801" title="Source: .">,</span></i> throwing certain roots on a fire, &amp;c., while using passes and phrases.
</p>
<p>As the Kaffir prophets, like other prophets, are often wrong, the term “Igogo” is
sometimes used to mean a pretender.
</p>
<p>They, as a rule, receive no fees.

<p>“Umlozi” means a whistle or whistling sound. A doctor of whistlings is one who pretends
to hear a whistling noise about, <i>e.g.</i>, in the roof of the hut, which gives him the instructions required as to which charms,
roots, drugs, &amp;c., are good for a certain case, and where to find them. He is a sort
of ventriloquist and physician; does not practice surgery; is paid the usual fees;
and is usually a Fingo.

</p>
<p>This is a consulting practitioner who does not use medicines. He will find out what
the disease is, and directs the patient to a regular practitioner; or he will point
out the sorcerer or bewitcher.
</p>
<p>The method adopted by this individual is described under Isanusi. He, however, is
a specialist in this line. He finds out by getting the people collected around him
to Vuma, or consent to various assertions made by himself, and judges by the loudness
of their Vuma and clapping of hands, whether he is near the truth or otherwise. <i>See</i> Isanusi.

</p>
<p class="center">Igqira elamatambo <br>(The doctor of bones.) <br>Plural—Amagqira Awamatambo.
</p>
<p>This is a class of practitioner chiefly found amongst the Basutos, who pretends to
find out things by the manner in which his “Indawuli” (Cape Dutch—Dolossi bones) fall
when thrown.
</p>
<p>These “Indawuli” may be thus described:—
</p>
<ul>
<li class="numberedItem"><span class="itemNumber">1.</span> Two flat pieces of bone, roughly carved, <i>i.e.</i>, the king and queen.<span class="pageNum" id="pb44">[<a href="#pb44">44</a>]</span></li>
<li class="numberedItem"><span class="itemNumber">2.</span> Two others, usually thicker pieces, and of the metatarsus of a calf, also ornamented,
<i>i.e.</i>, the ox of the king and queen respectively.</li>
<li class="numberedItem"><span class="itemNumber">3.</span> Eight metacarpal bones of sheep, <i>i.e.</i>, the common people.</li>
</ul><p>
</p>
<p>He proceeds thus:—Holding the bones in his hands, held horizontally, with a turn of
the wrist, he throws them on the ground as one would throw dice. He looks at their
relative position. Should they give no indication he throws again. This time perhaps
they lie favourably. The king touches one of the common people, and the queen is looking
in that direction. He then proceeds to give his opinion.
</p>
<p>These doctors are frequently very shrewd and possessed of wonderfully well trained
memories.
</p>
<p>By observation and information of spies, they know everybody’s business, and of every
event, and by reasoning are often able to judge correctly. There are well-known instances,
where the information received from these Amagqira has led to the discovery of lost
or stolen goods or cattle, after apparently all other means have been tried in vain.

<p>A 7. Igqira elobulongo, Amagqira awobulongo, (the doctor, who is of cowdung).
</p>
<p>This individual <span class="corr" id="xd31e892" title="Source: employes">employs</span> moist cowdung, often taken fresh from a recently slaughtered beast, to draw out the
evil spirits that are causing the disease. He proceeds thus:—A ball of cowdung is
secured over the affected parts, and after a time removed by the Igqira, who produces
from it by sleight of hand some charm, such as a lizard, previously had handy for
his purpose. These are the “Izidlanga,” diseased parts of the body or charms that
have been put into the patient by the evil spirits or bewitchers.

<p>This is a term used to designate the practitioner who professes to draw out the malady
by rubbing or grasping with the hand or sucking with the mouth. They often also use
herbs and leaves as applications, and, as in the case of the “Awobulongo” (cowdung
doctor), frequently produce things as the cause of the disease, the presence of which
they have previously arranged. Thus an Igqira Elokuqubula will suck over a painful
joint after having well rubbed it, and produce from his mouth a snake or lizard, previously
placed there, as the cause of the disease and pain.

</p>
<p>The following is a description given me by an educated native, who claimed to have
been cured of mortification, “Ubulima,” in this way. The doctor collects the patients
friends and makes them vuma, <i>i.e.</i>, confess to the disease, he then orders the slaughtering of a certain <span class="pageNum" id="pb47">[<a href="#pb47">47</a>]</span>cow, which he will most minutely describe, though he is supposed never to have seen
the herd. The cow is found and made a living sacrifice of.
</p>
<p>The beast is bound and thrown, and the people round, led by the doctor, stab it on
the navel and belly, and while the poor brute bellows from pain, the doctor and people
shout out “You are well;” “Get up,” etc., etc., and in some miraculous way the patient
is immediately cured of his pain. Another Agqira is then called in to complete the
cure by means of herbs, &amp;c., which frequently produce vomiting and purging.

<p>These Kaffir specialists show a considerable surgical skill. They are called in for

</p>
<p>In most cases the surgeon exhibits internal as well as external remedies, using purgatives
and emetics freely to assist healing and relieve pain.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb48">[<a href="#pb48">48</a>]</span></p>
<p>Blood-letting, as his name implies, is frequently had resort to by the native surgeon.
Thus, I know of a case where one of these Awokuqapula on his own initiative incised
the temporal artery for persistent neuralgia.
</p>
<p>Blood-letting by means of incisions or scarifications is frequently used to relieve
deep seated pain. A common method of treating pleuritic pain is to scarify over the
ribs and rub in some irritant.
</p>
<p>The native Surgeon, whether taught by outside practice or not, it is hard to say,
resorts to venesection as one of his routine methods of treatment for violent fevers.
He usually selects one of the veins of the forearm, using direct pressure to stop
the hæmorrhage when he considers that his patient has lost enough.
</p>
<p>A cupping instrument called “Luneka” and needles “Izinthlum” are used by the Kaffir
Surgeon for acupuncture and bleeding in such cases as snake bite, pleurisy, etc.
</p>
<p>Surgical cases of any degree are put in clean huts and usually on the top of a hill,
thus shewing that the Kaffir appreciates the value of fresh, clean surroundings: and
the ashes of plants (carbon) used for wounds shows a <span class="pageNum" id="pb49">[<a href="#pb49">49</a>]</span>spontaneous knowledge, that an antiseptic is of value in assisting healing.

from a large number of individuals, chiefly Native chiefs, educated Natives, Missionaries,
&amp;c., and, as in soliciting information terms understood by such had to be used, I
have continued to use the same terms, classifications and nomenclature of disease,
etc.
</p>
<p>“<span class="sc">Icesina</span>,” Fevers. Natural Diseases.
</p>
<p>There is a wand-like snake called “In-Gum-babane,” which is supposed to eat up the
man inside and thus cause death. The Kaffirs try to stop the entrance of the snake
or to arrest its progress by using bitter and strong smelling herbs, which they administer
internally, as well as by rubbing well all round the orifices of the body, mouth,
nose, anus, etc.
</p>
<p>A general method of treatment for these fevers as well as other constitutional diseases
is <span class="pageNum" id="pb53">[<a href="#pb53">53</a>]</span>called “Uku Nyakamisa Imbiza” (to wet a pot).
</p>
<p>This is carried out in the following way:—
</p>
<p>Roots of several kinds of medicinal plants are collected, placed in a gourd, covered
with water and allowed to soak. Of which infusion repeated doses are administered
to the patient. The supply of the infusion is kept up by adding more water until the
roots either shoot or putrify. The patient is then given a severe purge and emetic
and is expected to be cured.
</p>
<p><i>Measles.</i> I-Masisi. <i>Scarlatina.</i> I-Rashalala, or more usually Ungana. These two diseases are considered as one, scarlatina
being the more grave.
</p>
<p>Treatment:—<i>a</i> Fresh goats dung, “Ingqata,” is taken and boiled in goats milk and this drunk hot
in cupfulls. It helps to bring out the rash and cause profuse perspiration. The remaining
dung is dried, powdered, mixed with fat and rubbed all over the body. <i>b.</i> Wormwood (Um-hlonyane) is also sometimes used for steaming the patient, and if the
throat be bad, infusions are gargled, made from a mucilaginous wood the (Indlebe yemvu)
<span class="corr" id="xd31e1064" title="Source: Helichrysmum">Helichrysum</span> appendiculatum (Less).
</p>
<p><i>c.</i> The leaves and shoots of (Um-pafa) wait-a-bit thorn tree, are boiled, the steam inhaled
<span class="pageNum" id="pb54">[<a href="#pb54">54</a>]</span>and the concoction gargled.
</p>
<p><i>d.</i> The throat may be fomented and poulticed.
</p>
<p><i>e.</i> The poison taken from a snake, mixed with gall (from the snake) and clay is also
given in small quantities by some doctors.
</p>
<p>Mealie-meal porridge and meat-soups are allowed and solids forbidden. So it is in
all fevers.
</p>
<p><i>Smallpox.</i> In-gqakaqa, as in the case of Measles.
</p>
<p><i>Typhoid Fever.</i> I-cesina Seronya.
</p>
<p>This is the typical Kaffir fever disease, caused by the entrance of the snake, In-qumbabane
and its eating the patient up inside.
</p>
<p>Treatment:—<i>a.</i> The patient is steamed, dosed, and rubbed all over with wormwood (Unhlonyane), the
dosing being very liberal. All intended to prevent the snake killing the man and to
drive it out of him.
</p>
<p><i>b.</i> The following herbs are also used as the infusions of their roots:—I-tshongwe (Xysmalobium
lapatifolium) Dutch: Bitter wortel, and ubuvumba (Withania somnifera.)
</p>
<p>The residuum of any of the above infusions is well rubbed over the orifices, to prevent
the In-qumbabane from entering in numbers. The <span class="pageNum" id="pb55">[<a href="#pb55">55</a>]</span>couch and hut are strewn with the leaves of evil smelling plants and even nicotine
has been used to rub round the orifices, principally the anus, through which the snake
usually enters and the I-qwili (Alepidea amatymbica), an evil smelling plant is similarly
used.
</p>
<p>Diet as in fevers generally.
</p>
<p><i>Memo.</i> Owing to the practice of throwing refuse and excreta about the neighbourhood of kraals,
this disease, as might be expected, often occurs in epidemics.
</p>
<p><i>Anthrax.</i> I-dila. A disease well-known to the natives, and treated by their doctors with great
success.
</p>
<p>It is contracted by the natives feeding on the meat of anthractuose cattle. So confident
are the natives in their power to cure the disease, should it appear, that they have
little hesitation in eating the infected meat; a fair proof of the success of their
doctors’ practice. The procedure is this:—Generally speaking, be as early as possible,
for should the pustule, which under their treatment should rise properly, be allowed
by delay to subside, a native doctor will not undertake the case, as he considers
it useless to do so.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb56">[<a href="#pb56">56</a>]</span></p>
<p>A decoction of two bacteria killing plants, and controlled by a sedative plant, is
given internally in oft repeated doses. Externally a paste of the leaves of the same
plants is put around, not on the pimples, to limit the local disease and prevent the
<span class="corr" id="xd31e1111" title="Source: inflamation">inflammation</span> spreading. The pustule itself is treated by dropping the juice of a sedative plant
on it. It is left uncovered and freely exposed to the air, and the application made
from time to time until the scab falls off. The Kaffir believes, and experience has
been his guide, that the pustule must be left alone, and meddling with it, either
by incision, excision or irritation is dangerous treatment.
</p>
<p>1. Internally: The usual prescription is:—
</p>
<p>Blepharis Capensis (Ubu-hlungu basig­cawa) leaves and roots one part: Cluytia hirsuta
(Ubuhlungu bedila), leaves one part and Monsonia ovata (Igqita), two parts. Use about
5oz. of this mixture made into a decoction of a pint and take about a tablespoonful
6–8 times daily till recovery.
</p>
<p>2. Externally.
</p>
<p>Blepharis Capensis 2 parts, <span class="corr" id="xd31e1119" title="Source: Cluytya">Cluytia</span> and Monsonia one part each. Rub up to paste with lard and apply all round the pustule.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb57">[<a href="#pb57">57</a>]</span></p>
<p>3. Locally.
</p>
<p><i>i.e.</i> On the pustule. The juice squeezed from the green leaves of Monsonia.
</p>
<p>Withania somnifera (Ubu vumba) is sometimes used instead of Monsonia.
</p>
<p>Another method sometimes adopted is to use the Cluytia alone. Administer an infusion,
and apply a soft paste of the leaves all over the affected part.
</p>
<p>Other drugs used are:—<i>a</i> Matricaria nigellœfolia, (Um-hlonyane womlambo) (river wormwood) used in the same
way as the Cluytia.
</p>
<p><i>b</i> Xanthoxylon Capense, (um-Nungumabele) (wild cardamon), mostly taken as a condiment
with the anthractuous beef to disinfect it.
</p>
<p><i>c</i> Teucrium Africanum (Ubu-hlungu benyushu) same as Xanthoxylon.
</p>
<p><i>d</i> Solanum nigrum, (Umsobo) and
</p>
<p><i>e</i> Lippia asperifolia, (in-Zinziniba).
</p>
<p>These two last are risky and poisonous.
</p>
<p><i>Malaria.</i> Inkatazi tonizimba, a disease sent by dissatisfied ancestors.
</p>
<p><i>Treatment.</i> Sacrifices, singing, and dancing are practised round the sick to satisfy the ancestors.
</p>
<p>Vomitives and purgatives are used and by some the <span class="corr" id="xd31e1155" title="Source: Lasiosyphon">Lasiosiphon</span> Meisneri, one of the <span class="pageNum" id="pb58">[<a href="#pb58">58</a>]</span>“Snakebite” drugs is used, the dose being ½&nbsp;oz. of the dried root taken as an infusion.
</p>
<p>Malaria is not a prevalent disease amongst the Kaffirs owing principally to the fact
that their kraals are always built on high ground.

<h3 class="main"><span class="divNum"><i>B.</i></span> CONSTITUTIONAL DISEASES.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first"><i>Syphilis.</i> I-gcushiuva or I-hashe elingwevu (grey horse) to be distinguished from I-hashe (gonorrhoea)
which latter is treated by fomentations and is not common.
</p>
<p>The leaves of the Paramelia conspersa, (Ubu-lembu belitye) a lichen of very bitter
taste, are used in infusion, and the dry powder used on the sores, or mixed with fat
as an ointment.
</p>
<p>In the same manner Cisampelos campensis or the Solanum melongena, (Um-tuma) or the
Withania somnifera, (Ubu-vumba) may be used and are believed to have cured many cases.
</p>
<p>The natives state that this disease was introduced by the white man, and certainly
it is within the knowledge of many that even in the last twenty years its prevalence
has greatly increased among the tribes, probably due to the common use of drinking
and other utensils and the close and often overcrowded life led at night in the huts.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb59">[<a href="#pb59">59</a>]</span></p>
<p>Another undoubted cause of spread is the lewd practices which accompany, of late years,
the ceremonies of Intonyane and Abakweta at puberty.
</p>
<p><i>Leprosy.</i> I-qenqa or In-Gqinda, said to be caused by suddenly seeing the Icanti in his natural
form in the river. This suddenly seeing something is called “Ukwalama” and a person
who has thus seen the Icanti must not talk until he has been doctored lest he take
some disease such as the I-qenqa.
</p>
<p>Some of the Kaffir doctors blame Hottentots (an altogether different race) for having
introduced leprosy among them from the Cape Colony. It is certainly a disease of comparatively
recent occurrence amongst the Kaffir.
</p>
<p>Treatment. If seen in the early stages the leaves of the Umsolo omkulu, a plant found
in marshy places, are bruised and boiled. The decoction is drunk and used as a lotion
locally.
</p>
<p>Under this treatment the sores are said to diminish or even disappear.
</p>
<p>Note. From what I can gather the skin manifestations, are, as one would expect, confused
with other skin diseases such as eczema psoriasis &amp;c.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb60">[<a href="#pb60">60</a>]</span></p>
<p><i>Mortification.</i> Uku fa (death.)
</p>
<p>A case of spreading gangrene of the hand came under my notice which was treated by
a Native doctor, my patient refusing resolutely to have the hand amputated. The method
of his doctor was the following: In the floor of a small hut a hole was dug four feet
deep by one foot diameter and this filled with soft dung, taken, warm from the intestine
of an ox killed for that purpose. The patient was laid on his side and his arm fixed
down in this hole where it was kept for ten days; the patient in the meantime being
fed freely of the ox’s meat and soup, as well as being freely supplied with Kaffir
beer. The doctor was practically continuously in attendance all the time. Result,
gangrene stopped and spontaneous amputation at the seat of the disease, lower third
of the forearm. He <span class="corr" id="xd31e1190" title="Source: imformed">informed</span> me that the bones stuck out when his arm was withdrawn and some sinews were adherent
to the diseased hand. The bones were forcibly broken off and the sinews cut. When
I saw the wound it was healing very slowly and he came to me to see if some salve
would not heal it.
</p>
<p>Gangrene of parts after accident, or foul sores are all treated with poultices, powder
or <span class="pageNum" id="pb61">[<a href="#pb61">61</a>]</span>ointments made from the Um-sintsi (large Kaffir broom), Withania (Ubu-vumba) etc.
</p>
<p><i>Scurvy</i> is unknown to the native in his uncivilised state, and owing to the large proportion
of his diet being vegetable, it must be of extremely rare occurrence.
</p>
<p><i>Rheumatism</i>, <i>Gout</i>. Isi-dlanga or in-dubula. These are not <span class="corr" id="xd31e1205" title="Source: defferentiated">differentiated</span> though fairly common, especially, however, amongst the natives who, owing to their
going at times near the European villages, are forced to wear European costumes, usually
terribly dilapidated. If called in-dubula it is supposed to be ideopathic, due to
natural causes, and the name is that used to <span class="corr" id="xd31e1208" title="Source: distiuguish">distinguish</span> a small hairy insect, the patient feeling as if it were this insect gnawing at his
joints.
</p>
<p>Treatment: In these cases one of the “Amgqira Awokuqubula” is called in, and he, after
rubbing etc., applies his mouth to the part and sucks out the disease, spitting out
one of these insects as proof of his success. Or one of (Amagqira-awobulongo); cow-dung
doctors, who applying his cow-dung poultice with much ceremony, will when removing
it later, also produce an ocular proof of his <span class="pageNum" id="pb62">[<a href="#pb62">62</a>]</span>having got away the tormentor.
</p>
<p>The Kaffirs have for generations been in the habit of using the leaves of the Um-gcunube
(Salix Capensis) or Cape river willow for the cure of rheumatic pains. This is a curious
fact, when one realizes that these leaves are rich in “Salicin” the very drug used
as a specific in modern medicine.
</p>
<p><i>Scrofula.</i> I-hashe. This is a fairly common disease, looked upon as due to bad blood or weak
parents.
</p>
<p>Treatment: A very large variety of herbs is used by the Amagqira Awemiciza for this
disease either as a paste to external manifestations or internally in infusion. The
best known are:—

find. The sufferer finds the burrow of a hare and stooping down, calls down the hole

<p><i>Mothers Marks.</i> “Isifo” are looked upon as the result of some item in the ceremony of the “Intonjane”
(menstruation ceremony), or marriage ceremony of the mother having been omitted. The
mother is often sent back to the parents, who have to return the lobola (price of
a wife paid by the husband to the parents); or the child is weaned at once, doctored
by incantations, etc., the while the mother confesses her sins before the people.

<p>Are all looked upon as different manifestations of the same disease, caused by coming
across the Icanti. Vide “Leprosy.”
</p>
<p>Treatment is <span class="corr" id="xd31e1384" title="Source: discribed">described</span> under leprosy.
</p>
<p>Another method of treating these diseases chiefly Eczema is to gather the little cones
of mud raised on the banks of a stream by a small crab or worm and rub the sores with
the mud; or to collect specimens of all the available riverside medicinal herbs, boil
them, and with this decoction freely bathe and massage the patient, after which the
remainder is taken to that part of the river where the sick man is supposed to have
been smitten, and there thrown in while the sick man shouts something equivalent to
“<span class="corr" id="xd31e1389" title="Source: Dont">Don’t</span> stare at me with those eyes.”
</p>
<p><i>Lupus.</i> Isitshangubo is treated thus:
</p>
<p><i>a.</i> Pieces of sneezewood (Umtote) are burnt and the resinous juice (Incinde) which exudes
from the ends of the stick is rubbed into the spot while still warm. As it dries on
it forms a covering, which in time falls off with a scab. If needed the process is
repeated.
</p>
<p><i>b.</i> The fleshy branches of the Isi-hlehle (a <span class="pageNum" id="pb68">[<a href="#pb68">68</a>]</span>kind of Euphorbia usually found in clusters on the ground) are bruised and the milky
juice, very caustic in action, carefully rubbed on: the process being repeated from
time to time.
</p>
<p><i>Psoriasis.</i> Umkondo, attributed to the sufferer having crossed the track of the Icanti (see leprosy).
</p>
<p>Treatment. Umsolo omkulu, a plant resembling the Ityolo is used here. The leaves are,
bruised, put into a vessel covered with water and stirred briskly and for a time (Ukupehla).
After much stirring a thickish lather as of soapsuds rises and this is applied externally,
the liquor being taken in ounce doses frequently repeated.
</p>
<p>The roots of the Ipuzi-lomlambo (Gunnera perpensa; river <span class="corr" id="xd31e1409" title="Source: pumkin">pumpkin</span>) are sometimes prepared and used in the same way.
</p>
<p>The Um-nyanji (Phytolacca stricta), a vomitive, used much in chest cases and also
in snake poisoning is sometimes administered in small doses and also applied externally.
</p>
<p><i>Warts.</i> In-tsumpa.
</p>
<p>Treatment <i>a.</i> The milk of the Isihlehle a species of Euphorbia is painted on the wart, <span class="pageNum" id="pb69">[<a href="#pb69">69</a>]</span>and causes it to wither. <i>b.</i> The juice (Incinde) which comes out of <span class="corr" id="xd31e1425" title="Source: Sneezwood">Sneezewood</span> twigs (Um-tote) when they are burned is used similarly. <i>c.</i> When large, a fine piece of hide is firmly tied round them and they in time fall
off.
</p>
<p><i>Baldness.</i> Ubu-Nquyi (a bald person In-Nquyi).
</p>
<p>No treatment is used and a bald person is considered wise and eloquent in speaking,
and likely to be rich; but curiously enough he is expected to become so by sly and
cunning means not necessarily of a high moral standard.
</p>
<p>There are few Bald Kaffirs.
</p>
<p><i>Amaas.</i> A disease fairly common amongst Kaffirs, occuring in epidemics and variously described
by medical men as Small-pox <i>i.e.</i> in its severe forms, or chicken-pox, in its milder manifestations. Many hold that
it is a disease sui generis.
</p>
<p>The treatment adopted is the same as in a case of Smallpox.
</p>
<p><i>Ringworm.</i> <i>a.</i> The leaf pulp and yellow juice of the In-gcelwane (Aloe soponaria) is well rubbed
into the patches. <i>b.</i> A paste of <span class="pageNum" id="pb70">[<a href="#pb70">70</a>]</span>the green berries of the Um-sobo (Solanum nigrum) similarly. <i>c.</i> A paste of the green berries of the Ubu vumba (Withania somnifera) <i>d.</i> The milky juice of the In-tsema, a large wild bulb.
</p>
<p>The natives are very successful in their treatment of this disease, which is fairly
common amongst them, and believed by them to be caught from a dog. Dogs are found
everywhere where Kaffirs do congregate, and certainly, if one is to judge by the appearance
of the curs one sees about a Basuto or Fingo kraal, they are a very likely source
of skin disease.

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first"><i>Paralysis.</i> I-dumbe is attributed entirely to supernatural causes and for its treatment the Isanuse
(witch-doctor) is called in to find out, “who has bewitched him.” The bewitcher may
be severely dealt with.
</p>
<p><i><span class="corr" id="xd31e1465" title="Source: Epilipsy">Epilepsy</span>.</i> (Fits) Isi-tutwani is recognised as a constitutional disease and treated by the Igqira
elemiciza (herb doctor). His method is as follows:—<i>a.</i> Various Herbs are mixed, which administered in decoction, act as a strong <span class="pageNum" id="pb71">[<a href="#pb71">71</a>]</span>emetic. A sheep is killed and the dung from its entrails is rubbed all over the patient’s
body. He is now made to stand up in a hole made in a large ant-heap, Isi-duli (in
Kaffirland these ant-heaps are often very large), and the emetic administered till
vomiting is induced, the remainder being poured over him to wash off the dung. The
hole is then covered up and the disease supposed to be left there. He now goes home,
and avoids this spot for ever afterwards. Should this treatment fail the following
is adopted.
</p>
<p><i>b.</i> The sick man is treated as before, only at home in his hut. The refuse, <i>i.e.</i> vomited matter and washed off dung is burned in a brisk fire and the ashes used as
Umhlabelo, medicine used in lancing (Ukuquapula) in the following way.
</p>
<p>An incision is made above the forehead, the blood being collected carefully and subsequently
buried at the threshold of the hut; and this Umhlabelo well rubbed into the incision.
</p>
<p><i>c.</i> Another method I have had described is to lance the temple, collect the blood and
having caught a hare and lanced its head between the ears, to rub the patient’s blood
into the wound and let the hare go free, the <span class="pageNum" id="pb72">[<a href="#pb72">72</a>]</span>spectators and patient not daring to see the hare depart. Similarly a cock may be
used (failing the hare), its beak soaked in the blood and it allowed to go free.
</p>
<p><i>d.</i> A most prized, and secret cure for “fits” is the administration of about a tablespoonful
of a decoction in goats milk of the leaves of Exomis oxyrioides. This is a method
used in the domestic medicine of the back-country Boer, who calls the bush “Honde
bos” (dog bush) and is said to be very successful.
</p>
<p>N.B.—the watery decoction of this is dangerous and strongly soporific.
</p>
<p><i>Insanity.</i> U-gezo. Three varieties are recognised.
</p>
<p>1st U-gezo proper, probably mostly delirium or convulsions, which is treated the same
way as “Isi-tutwani” epilepsy. Here also the herb Um-nyanji (Phytolacca stricta) and
other emetics are used till the patient is utterly prostrate, when he is left to slowly
recover, while being fed on goats milk.
</p>
<p>2nd A form of madness known to attack those who are in the initiation or student stage
for the position of Isanusi, when they are supposed to be in communication with the
<span class="pageNum" id="pb73">[<a href="#pb73">73</a>]</span>“Imi-shologu” departed spirits. During the initiation the candidate is hypnotised
by the Isanuse and made to see and converse with these spirits, as it is from them
that all his knowledge comes when in practice. As one would expect, the impressions
of the lessons are at times lasting and unhinge the minds of weak ones, who continue
to have delusions and are then considered to be possessed by their departed ancestors.
In the treatment of this, therefore, every endeavour is made to propitiate these ancestors,
by sacrifices and offerings, mostly with the assistance of one of the witch doctors.
In the old days of Chacka a case is recorded as occurring, and after treatment had
failed either to kill or cure, the maniac was sent to join his ancestors by order
of the king (the greatest doctor). A truly summary method of at once appeasing the
offended spirits and getting rid of a troublesome customer.
</p>
<p>3rd. Uku-posela, evidently Acute Mania, attributed to being bewitched by some one
having a grudge, and the process of smelling out “Ukunuka” as described previously
is gone through.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb74">[<a href="#pb74">74</a>]</span></p>
<p><i>Tetanus.</i> Supposed to be due to having crossed the path of the Icanti (water snake) or Inamba
(python) and the plants used in snakebite are administered as well as the usual observance
of ceremonies calculated to appease the wrath of the ancestor whom the snake represents.
</p>
<p><i>Sunstroke.</i> Uku-zolika or Uku-hlatywa lilanga, is well recognised and fairly common amongst the
workers of the fields.
</p>
<p>Treatment. 1. The sufferer is placed in as cool a place as is available, soused with
cold water, and drugged with emetics and purgatives.
</p>
<p>2. Seated in a cool spot on the ground his finger and thumb tips are freely incised
so that he may bleed, and he is dosed freely with Ubuhlungu (teucrium Capense), a
carminative snakebite cure.
</p>
<p><i>Toothache.</i> Ama-zinyo. The Kaffirs say that in the old days this was unknown, and they attribute
it now to eating food cooked and hot.
</p>
<p>Treatment. Small doses and local application of Ubuhlungu benyoka “Acocanthera venenata”
a nervine tonic and favourite snake-bite <span class="pageNum" id="pb75">[<a href="#pb75">75</a>]</span>cure are used; or the sufferer chews the bark of the Um-nungumabele (Xanthoxylon Capense)
and expectorates the juice; or a paste may be made of the powdered bark and placed
in the hollow tooth (this is another favourite snakebite and anthrax drug). Other
plant drugs used in much the same way are:—
</p>
<ul>
<li>Ubuhlungu besigcawu (Blepharis Capensis)</li>
<li>Um-tumana (Solanum Capense)</li>
<li>Isi-dikili (<span class="corr" id="xd31e1520" title="Source: Lasiosyphon">Lasiosiphon</span> Meisneri)</li>
<li>Root of Indegofera potens.</li>
</ul><p>
</p>
<p>All having distinct antiseptic and anæsthetic values.
</p>
<p>The Kaffir surgeon or domestic sympathiser tries to extract the offending tooth by
means of a strip of thong tied to it.
</p>
<p>Speaking generally the Kaffirs have splendid teeth and take great care of them by
frequent <span class="corr" id="xd31e1529" title="Source: cleasing">cleansing</span>.
</p>
<p><i>Headache.</i>
</p>
<p><i>a.</i> I-yeza Elininyama (Anemone Caffra) is used; the root being dried, powdered and used
as a snuff. Should this fail the upper rootstalk is burned and the smoke inhaled;
while a paste of the leaves is rubbed into or bound on the affected part.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb76">[<a href="#pb76">76</a>]</span></p>
<p><i>b.</i> Um-hlavutwa (Ricinus communis) is also used externally as a paste and internally
in decoction.
</p>
<p>A common practice is to bind the head firmly with a thong.

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first"><i>Thrush.</i> Ama-vila, said to be caused by the child eating green mealies off the cob and leaving
its saliva on a cob that is accidently burnt; or putting its father’s pipe into its
mouth.
</p>
<p>Treatment. The mouth is frequently washed out, either with an infusion of the leaves
of Isi-duli (Brachylæna elliptica) or an infusion of Mimosa bark.
</p>
<p><i>Quinsy.</i> Um-qala. Gargles are used of hot infusions of Isi-duli, Mimosa, or bitter olive tree,
etc.
</p>
<p><i>Diphtheria.</i> I have no record of this disease being recognised by the Kaffir as anything but sorethroat
Umqala, if it occur at all.
</p>
<p><i>Dyspepsia and Indigestion.</i> I-dliso.
</p>
<p>Believed to be caused by eating poisonous foods, and usually treated by emetics <i>e.g.</i> In-kamamasane (Euphorbia pugniformis) one <span class="pageNum" id="pb77">[<a href="#pb77">77</a>]</span>of the class of drugs known amongst the natives as Intsema, acting as a severe emetic
and purge. The juice tapped from the living stem of these plants is collected in maize
meal and made into a bolus to be swallowed; about half a drachm of the drug being
taken at a time. As this is nearly as severe as croton oil, the action is easily to
be understood and in a country and nation where at times great overfeeding and gorging
is practiced, such a treatment is a valuable asset.
</p>
<p>Another favourite purge is Um-gwali (Euclea lanceolata), the bark of the roots being
used.
</p>
<p><i>Colic.</i> Uku kunywa or I-honya.
</p>
<p>Treatment. <i>a.</i> The Powdered root of In-nyongwane, (Deconia anomala) is administered in cold water.
</p>
<p>This plant is also put to a curious use by the Kaffir. When visiting a strange place
he eats some of it, believing that if he gets poisoned food he will immediately vomit
it.
</p>
<p><i>b.</i> The knobs from the roots of the in-dawa (Cyperus) are used, either chewed as they
are or as an infusion of the powdered knob. It has an aromatic pungent taste.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb78">[<a href="#pb78">78</a>]</span></p>
<p><i>c.</i> The powdered root of I-qwili (Alepidea amatymbica) is also used for colic or abdominal
pain, a teaspoonful to a dose.
</p>
<p>In larger doses this drug is an emetic and purgative, in smaller a stomachic.
</p>
<p><i>d.</i> Um-bangandlela (Heteromorpha arborescens) is also used in infusion.
</p>
<p>Purgatives are used and sometimes injections. This is one of the diseases which lend
themselves so well to the treatment of the Amagqira Awokuqubula or doctors who use
massage and sucking accompanied by incantations, and profess to produce, in the form
of a lizard, frog, or something, the cause of the disease.
</p>
<p>The Awobulongo, cow-dung doctors are also successful in this illness.
</p>
<p><i>Stitch.</i> Ili-hlaba is treated by rubbing the part and administering infusions of the root
of the Ili-bulawa (<span class="corr" id="xd31e1594" title="Source: Sebœa">Sebæa</span> crassulæfolia), a bitter astringent used also in dysentery and colic.
</p>
<p><i>Vomiting.</i> In-hlanzo, caused by bewitchment or poisoning is arrested by copious draughts of
hot water followed by purgatives.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb79">[<a href="#pb79">79</a>]</span></p>
<p><i>Dysentery</i> or <i>Diarrhœa</i>. Uxaxazo referred to gastronomic errors and treated by:
</p>
<p><i>a.</i> I-yeza lezikali (Pelargonium reneforme) administered hot as a decoction in milk of
the powdered root, about a teaspoonful of the powder.
</p>
<p><i>b.</i> Um-tuma (Solanum Capense) as in (<i>a</i>).
</p>
<p><i>c.</i> I-gqita (Monsonia ovata). Much used and valued in this disease. It is sedative and
astringent and now used as a tincture in the armamentarium of most colonial physicians,
and by some considered very valuable in Typhoid fever.
</p>
<p><i>Jaundice.</i> I-nyongo (bile) believed to be due to too long continuance of the same diet.
</p>
<p>Treatment: Diet is changed and purgatives administered.
</p>
<p><i>Gallstone</i> and its <i>colic</i><span id="xd31e1626"></span> are not recognised.
</p>
<p><i>Constipation.</i> Uku-qunjeliva.
</p>
<p>Treatment: 1. Sometimes enemata are administered. The method adopted being, to insert
the smaller end of a cowhorn, with the point cut off, into the bowel and having filled
the horn with the required liquid to blow with <span class="pageNum" id="pb80">[<a href="#pb80">80</a>]</span>the mouth applied to the other end and so empty the horn of its contents into the
bowel.
</p>
<p>2. Many purgatives are known and used, the chief being <i>a.</i> Um-quali (Euclea lanceolata) of which the bark of the roots is used.
</p>
<p><i>b.</i> In-kamamasane (<span class="corr" id="xd31e1642" title="Source: Euqhorbia">Euphorbia</span> pugniformis) The milk from the stem is a drastic cathartic, and like croton oil an
escharotic.
</p>
<p><i>c.</i> Um-hlaba (Aloe ferox). The long fleshy leaves of this plant are broken off and hung
up in a sun over a vessel. The juice which collects is dried in the sun, and being
mixed with meal or clay is used in the form of a pill.
</p>
<p>In some parts the juice of this aloe is used by the natives, dropped into the eye,
for purulent ophthalmia.
</p>
<p>There are many other cathartics known to and used by the native doctors as well as
domestically.
</p>
<p><i>Obstruction of the bowels.</i> Uku-quina.
</p>
<p>Treatment: All the usual cathartics may be tried and they failing, the rubbing doctor
“Igqira-elokuqubula,” may be called in who massages the belly. If he fails the person
must be bewitched; when the witch doctor is requisitioned to see the end of the chapter
and have <span class="pageNum" id="pb81">[<a href="#pb81">81</a>]</span>someone punished for the result.
</p>
<p><i>Peritonitis.</i> <i><span class="corr" id="xd31e1662" title="Source: Inflamation">Inflammation</span> of the bowels</i><span id="xd31e1665"></span> is treated generally as colic and fever.
</p>
<p><i>Dropsy.</i> I can get no authentic record of this being recognised. One informant calling it
“Igalimoya” gives as a method of treatment used the injection and administration by
the mouth of infusions of Utangazano (Cucumis Africanus) a wild cucumber, which is
a hydrogogue cathartic.
</p>
<p><i>Piles.</i> U-mzi.
</p>
<p><i>a.</i> Charms are used to cause their disappearance, <i>e.g.</i>, I-kubalo or lika Mlanjeni (Pelargonium pulverulentum) of which the leaves are chewed.
</p>
<p>These leaves were given to the warriors in the Kaffir Wars of 1850, as war medicine,
by the great witch doctor Mlanjeni, to charm away the British bullets, and make the
guns miss fire. Kaffirs were found, dead on the field, who had these leaves chewed
in their mouths.
</p>
<p><i>b.</i> Another method of treatment is to mash into a pulp the rootstalk of the Isi-kolokoto
<span class="pageNum" id="pb82">[<a href="#pb82">82</a>]</span>(<span class="corr" id="xd31e1684" title="Source: Sansivira">Sansevieria</span> thyrsiflora) and use the pulp locally and internally.
</p>
<p><i>Thread worms.</i> Izlio.
</p>
<p><i>Tape worm.</i> I-palo.
</p>
<p><i>Round worms.</i> Intshulube.
</p>
<p>These are all grouped for treatment as worms and submitted to the same kind of treatment.
As they are very common amongst the Kaffirs there is a very large variety of remedies.
</p>
<p>The following are a selection from many more.
</p>
<p>1. Iyeza lentshulube (Hibiscus trionum.)
</p>
<p>2. Isi-kolokoto (<span class="corr" id="xd31e1702" title="Source: Sansiviera">Sansevieria</span> <span class="corr" id="xd31e1705" title="Source: thyrsflora">thyrsiflora</span>), of which the root is used.
</p>
<p>3. Ikalana (Aloe tenuior) one of the best of these drugs. It is cathartic as well
as <span class="corr" id="xd31e1710" title="Source: toenicide">taenicide</span> and non-poisonous in ordinary doses. For tape worm a decoction of the roots is taken
on an empty stomach, after purgation.
</p>
<p>4. Um-fincafincane (Leontis leonurus), the leaves and flowers are used in decoction
or powder.
</p>
<p>5. I-dolo lenkonyana (Rumex Eckloni) of which the roots are taken, boiled in sweet
milk.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb83">[<a href="#pb83">83</a>]</span></p>
<p>6. Um-muncwane (Oxalis Smithii). A handful of the dried bulbs is boiled in milk and
the decoction drunk.
</p>
<p>7. In-nyinga (Agremonia Capensis) a paste of the leaves with sour milk.
</p>
<p>8. A decoction of a mixture of Um nukambeba (Myeris inequalis), of Um-nungumabele
(Xanthoxylon Capense) and of Um-nquma (olive) is used.
</p>
<p>9. Crushed pumpkin seeds are also used. About 30 seeds slightly roasted being the
usual dose.
</p>
<p><i>Kidney Disease</i><span id="xd31e1724"></span> is unknown; but urinary troubles are treated. Thus for painful micturition and difficult
as well as scanty or thick urine a decoction of the root of Um-tumana (Solanum Capense)
may be tried.
</p>
<p><i>General Debility.</i> Tonics are used by the igqira elemiciza thus:
</p>
<p>1. I-tshongwe (Xysmalobium latifolium) of which the root is infused and the liquor
which is exceedingly bitter, drunk.
</p>
<p>2. Ubu-hlungu benyushu (Teucrium Africanum) a few grains of the dried bark being a
dose.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb84">[<a href="#pb84">84</a>]</span></p>
<p>3. In-dawa (Cyperus.) The knobs which grow on the roots, have a strong, bitter, pungent
and aromatic flavour. These are used for this condition as also for colic.
</p>
<p>4. Ubu-hlungu bedilia (Cluytia hirsuta) of which the leaves are chewed or taken in
infusion.
</p>
<p>A person suffering from prolonged debility unrelieved by treatment, naturally (for
a Kaffir) comes to believe that he is under the malign influence of someone around
him who is working on him by means of witchcraft, and journeys are taken to get away
from the spell. Thus in a way the idea of “Change of Air<span id="xd31e1737"></span>” is practiced.

<h2 class="main">SURGERY.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first"><i>Fractures.</i> The Kaffir Surgeon (Igqira Elokuqapula) is fairly expert in such cases and carries
out a routine treatment. The usual drawing out of the limb is performed, replacing
any noticeable deformity. It is then held in position while the surgeon makes three
parallel incisions over the seat of fracture. Into these incisions he rubs the ashes
derived from burning the roots of certain plants “awatunga” of which one is the plumbago.
The limb thus treated is then bound firmly with strips of the inner bark of the mimosa
tree which form an excellent splint material. Some surgeons profess to know a “bone
root” which taken internally promotes rapid healing. I have been unable to identify
this. It is just possible that this incising and rubbing in of charcoal acts as a
counterirritant and thus prevents inflammatory mischief of deeper structures. The
selection of carbon in preference to other substances shows at least a rudimentary
knowledge of an antiseptic substance being preferable.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb86">[<a href="#pb86">86</a>]</span></p>
<p>Internally purgatives are <span class="corr" id="xd31e1750" title="Source: adminstered">administered</span> to promote healing and ease restlessness.
</p>
<p><i>Dislocations.</i> Are not generally <span class="corr" id="xd31e1756" title="Source: defferentiated">differentiated</span> from fractures.
</p>
<p><i>Healing Wounds.</i> Sufferers from extensive wounds are usually taken to the top of a neighbouring hill
and there kept in a newly built hut. (It would seem that some tradition had taught
these people that wounds heal best in fresh air and cleanly surroundings).
</p>
<p>In-kubele (Kaffir generic name for healing plants) are frequently used, thus:—
</p>
<p><i>a.</i> The wound is sometimes dressed by the application of the leaves of a small white
Lily soaked in brandy or Kaffir beer.
</p>
<p><i>b.</i> The leave of the Ungcelwane (Aloe latifolia) is cut open and the inner surface applied
to the wound. The juice of this is pungent and has a marked healing effect.
</p>
<p><i>c.</i> Swollen and inflamed wounds are poulticed with U-nomolwana (mallow leaves in paste),
which soon reduces the inflammation or brings the abscess to a point. When the wound
is cleaned in this way it is washed with a decoction of mallow leaves made in an <span class="pageNum" id="pb87">[<a href="#pb87">87</a>]</span>earthenware vessel (not a metal pot) and an application made of one of the in-kubele
(healing plants), <i>e.g.</i>, The leaves of the Pelargonium alchemilioides in the form of a paste.
</p>
<p>I have the record of a man with a perforating ulcer of the foot, who refused amputation
and who was ultimately cured by a Kaffir surgeon.
</p>
<p><i>d.</i> Callous ulcers or slow healing wounds are treated by applying the juice of the Isi-dikili
(Lasiosiphon Meisneri), which acts as a pretty considerable irritant and answers its
purpose admirably. It is also used internally in infusion as an alterative and blood
purifier.
</p>
<p><i><span class="corr" id="xd31e1783" title="Source: c">e</span>.</i> The leaves of the Iyeza lezikali (Pelargonium-reniforme) when boiled yield a mucilage
that is applied on and around wounds to protect them from flies which in this climate
rapidly breed maggots in unhealthy sores.
</p>
<p><i>f.</i> The leaves of the Ubu-shwa (Venidium arctotoides) are used for callous ulcers after
they have been scarified.
</p>
<p><i>g.</i> A paste of the leaves of I-dwara (Senecio latifolium) is used.
</p>
<p><i>h.</i> Um dambiso (Senecio concolor) also used in the form of a paste of the mashed leaves.
</p>
<p><i>i.</i> An ointment made by boiling in lard the <span class="pageNum" id="pb88">[<a href="#pb88">88</a>]</span>leaves of the Ubu-vumba (Withania somnifera) is frequently applied in painful cases.
</p>
<p><i>Burns.</i> The following is a graphic description of the mode of treating burns, given me by
a Fingo. It is certainly not a gentle one. Here is the case of a child who through
carelessness has fallen into the fire and lies screaming. It is found on examination
to have a severely burned arm and shoulder. The father takes the case in hand. He
goes out and secures some in-kubele (healing plants) and one or two mealie cobs (the
centre of the Indian-corn cob after the grain has been removed). He has some water
boiled and is now ready to commence operations. The child is laid over his knee, while
the mother stretches out the injured arm and holds it firmly. The whole of the charred
and injured tissues are firmly rubbed off with the mealie cob, which has been soaked
in the hot water, until the wound is considered clean.
</p>
<p>The screams of the child are not considered of any importance compared with the scraping
process which must be thorough.
</p>
<p>The wound is then freely dressed with the leaves or mashes used in healing wounds.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb89">[<a href="#pb89">89</a>]</span></p>
<p><i>Tumours and Abscesses.</i> Ama-fa, quba or i-tumba are looked upon as collections of bad blood growing out.
They, especially if painful are treated by poultices of various herbs (<i>vide</i> healing wounds) and if they point are frequently incised and evacuated.
</p>
<p>Large tumours are not touched and are considered, in some tribes, to be due to the
touch of a bewitcher.
</p>
<p><i>Lightning Stroke.</i> The Basutos attempt resuscitation in cases of apparent death from lightning stroke.
They lay the person on his back, extend his arms and make rythmical traction on the
tongue, the while the body and limbs are being well rubbed. Amongst most tribes a
person killed by lightning is looked on with great awe and as a rule no one will touch
him. The Isanusi is called, and after many incantations and purifyings, a hole is
dug near him and the body rolled into it. The spot is then “Isitshu,” sacred and enchanted.
The whole kraal is then put in “Coventry” and no communication allowed with anyone,
neighbours or visitors, for months. An isanuse is then engaged, paid a large fee and
proceeds <span class="pageNum" id="pb90">[<a href="#pb90">90</a>]</span>to purify all the people in the kraal by means of ceremonies and incantations.
</p>
<p>A beast, cow, ox etc., killed by lightning is treated in the same way (buried whole
and untouched), and the kraal avoided.
</p>
<p>The isanuse in purifying the inhabitants of a kraal for “lightning stroke” enchantment,
doses them freely with Is-cimambilo (Pentanisia variabilis) which, as its name implies,
extinguishes the fire.
</p>
<p>The <i>Grahamstown Journal</i> remarking on a recent case says. The reason why the corpse of the native, struck
by lightning, had been allowed to rot in the road for a week was because nobody could
be found to bury it. No Kaffir would go near it, as they say, if they meddle with
anything struck by lightning, or indeed go near it, not only will ill-luck attend
them always afterwards, but their very lives will be in danger from the “fiery bolts
of Jove.”
</p>
<p>In Tembuland the lightning had been unusally active, one hot season, and had killed
several cattle. The natives would not allow any stranger to enter their kraals, and
if by chance anyone got in he had to stay there. No food was given to strangers and
they were <span class="pageNum" id="pb91">[<a href="#pb91">91</a>]</span>warned off. This was the inhospitable state of affairs till the Amagqira had done
their duty and driven off the lightning.
</p>
<p>The natives say the lightning is really a bird which they call “Impundulu” or the
lightning bird.
</p>
<p>This bird appears as such only to women; but as lightning it darts down and lays a
big egg, where it strikes, which eggs bring ill-luck to the neighbourhood where it
is laid.
</p>
<p>The only way to circumvent the bird, is to stand ready with a kerrie (club) and hit
right through the flash. (Putting salt on its tail in fact). Needless to say that
no one has ever succeeded in killing one yet. The Isanusi is supposed to dig for this
egg in order to destroy it, but so far none has been demonstrated to the common public.
Great hopes are entertained for the future! The possession of the egg would bring
great good fortune to the possessor.
</p>
<p>In olden times the “doctor” was a really clever man in many cases, would come and
do work for a bull, cow, or even heifer; but now the “Doctors” have sadly deteriorated,
and first his fee of a bottle of brandy, three shillings, <span class="pageNum" id="pb92">[<a href="#pb92">92</a>]</span>and a roll of tobacco must be paid before he will fix up the case.
</p>
<p>Need we remark doctors are now not so much used or respected. Down near Alexandria
in 1894, we know of only one hut being burnt down in the whole year. That hut, the
doctors say was burned down by the lightning bird. The lightning struck near the huts
of two men. They rushed out and began digging for all they were worth; but failed
to find the eggs. Then one of them called in an Isanuse, and his place and himself
were “disinfected,” he paying besides the usual fee a bull calf. The other man had
no brandy, no money, no tobacco, and the doctor loved him not. The former is a wealthy
native now, owns a lot of cattle, and has two wagons and plenty of wives and children;
the latter man’s hut was burnt down a week afterwards, and his little store of fifty
bags of grain, totally destroyed. Of course the lightning bird as I said before “fired
that hut.”
</p>
<p><i>Opththalmia.</i> I-ndloloti.
</p>
<p>Treatment. <i>a.</i> The fresh juice of the umhlaba (Alœ ferox) is dropped into the eye with good effect.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb93">[<a href="#pb93">93</a>]</span></p>
<p><i>b.</i> U-tywala bentaka (Lantano salviæfolia) in the form of an infusion of the fresh leaves
or at times the dried leaves is used. It is very astringent, causes much smarting
and only used in severe cases.
</p>
<p><i>c.</i> The juice pressed from the leaves of U-watile (Hippobromus alata) is dropped into
the eye; or by some, these leaves are chewed and the saliva applied.
</p>
<p><i>d.</i> Iyeza bamehlo (Scabiosa columbaria) in infusion of the root.
</p>
<p><i>e.</i> I-ran (Urtica) nettle. Of this a paste is made of the leaves and used externally.
</p>
<p>Other affections of the eye are not specialised.
</p>
<p><i>Snake-bite</i> is a very common occurrence and one in the treatment of which the Native is fairly
expert.
</p>
<p>I should before describing the treatment, notice the curious fact that the native
never wastes a snake. One seen is pursued till killed, then its gall bladder is emptied
and the gall mixed with the venom from its venom sacks, and these mixed with clay
into a bolus, which is then in part or whole, swallowed, usually in two doses of a
day’s interval. The immediate effect is one of pleasant somnolence, and according
to the <span class="pageNum" id="pb94">[<a href="#pb94">94</a>]</span>Native, the ultimate effect and that aimed at, is more or less complete immunity from
the dangers of snake-bite for the future.
</p>
<p>Some Natives as a result of this practice acquire immunity and will handle poisonous
snakes with a freedom from fear, only accounted for by a conviction of its being safe
for them to do so.
</p>
<p>The general method of treatment is:—
</p>
<p>The bitten limb is at once tied with a thong or anything available between the body
and the bite and the wound freely incised and bled. A native cupping-glass “luneka”
(a cow’s horn open at either end, suction by the mouth being applied at the smaller)
is then thoroughly used. The patient is in the meantime dosed freely with one or other
of the numerous snake-bite cures, a mash of the leaves being finally put on as a poultice.
</p>
<p>In some tribes a pit is dug, and filled with bushes, which are burnt. The ashes are
rapidly raked out, and the bitten man rolled in skins placed in it so as to induce
an excessive perspiration, while plant infusions are freely administered. Not a bad
attempt at a domestic Turkish bath.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb95">[<a href="#pb95">95</a>]</span></p>
<p>The snake-bite plants most commonly used by the Kaffirs are:—
</p>
<p>1. Um-fincafincane (Leontis leonurus) chiefly used by the Fingoes.
</p>
<p>2. Ubu-hlungu benyushu (Teucrium Africanum) chiefly used by Gcalekas, Tembus and Pondos.
</p>
<p>It is interesting to note that to some extent the native Igqira recognises the difference
of bites by different snakes, using a different species of Leontis for different cases.
</p>
<p>3. Ubu-hlungu-bemamba (Melianthus comosus) is a valued cure amongst the Pondos and
Gaikas. This bark of the root is used.
</p>
<p>This plant is also used for other poisonous bites <i>e.g.</i> The intojane, a poisonous caterpillar, of the shaggy tarantula, this latter being
very common in the thatch of huts.
</p>
<p>4. Ubu-hlungu besigcawu (Blepharis Capensis) is also used, as its name implies for
tarantula bite.
</p>
<p>5. Isi-dikili (Lasiosiphon Meisneri) in doses of ½&nbsp;oz. of dried root often repeated.
This plant is also used by the Gaikas as a gargle in sore throat and a paste for open
sores.
</p>
<p>6. Ubu-hlungu benyoko (Acocanthera venenata) a very poisonous plant. A small <span class="pageNum" id="pb96">[<a href="#pb96">96</a>]</span>piece of the leaf is rubbed up in cold water and administered. It produces violent
vomiting. Several deaths are directly traceable to the use of this highly dangerous
plant.
</p>
<p>Professor Sir T. Fraser of Edinburgh has extracted the active principle of this and
describes it (Acocantherine) as a glucoside, which powerfully increases the systolic
act of the heart, killing in this way.
</p>
<p>The Bushmen use this juice as an arrow poison.
</p>
<p>7. Ubu lembu belitye (Parmelia conspersa) is a lichen. Scraped off the rocks it is
used for snake and other venomous bites.
</p>
<p>8. Ili-bulawa. (Sebæa crassulæfolia) has been used with success in recorded cases
of puff-adder bite.
</p>
<p>9. Um-nungumabele (Xanthoxylon Capense). A decoction of the tree root is used.
</p>
<p>There are also many others.
</p>
<p>Kaffir beer is used as a stimulant in cases of collapse.

<p>Whereas this statement holds good for the commonality and some tribes, yet in others,
<i>e.g.</i>: The Basutos, the time and method of childbirth is very different.
</p>
<p>The woman when near her time returns to the kraal of her father, who pays the expenses
if any, and of her mother, who is chief superintendent of details. Some expert old
women of the tribe acts as midwife.
</p>
<p>A special hut is built and kept carefully clean. On the floor is spread a thick layer
of dry cowdung to collect the lochia etc<span class="corr" id="xd31e1912" title="Not in source">.</span>, and the woman usually sits near this in a crouching position. She may, however,
be on her knees or even lying down. A firm band is tied above <span class="pageNum" id="pb98">[<a href="#pb98">98</a>]</span>the uterus (to keep it from rising) and this is tied lower down after the birth.
</p>
<p>The child is received into the hands of an assistant; and the umbilical cord, usually
forcibly torn asunder several inches from the child’s abdomen. The cord may, however,
be cut or sometimes chewed through by the midwife. The abdomen is, during the birth,
rubbed and pressed, and the back assisted by an assistant.
</p>
<p>In very serious cases and only in extremis an Igqrira elemicisa is called in, who
however, seldom does much more than administer herbs<span class="corr" id="xd31e1919" title="Not in source">.</span>
</p>
<p>To facilitate labour, and strengthen the uterine contractions, the natives administer
the root of the Um-kanzi (Typha latifolia).
</p>
<p>Other herbs are used also for the purpose, one igqira being in the habit of getting
his patient <span class="corr" id="xd31e1924" title="Source: stupified">stupefied</span> by much smoking of dagga<span id="xd31e1927"></span> (Indian hemp).
</p>
<p>Two months after the birth of the child the mother reappears in public; but should
the child be still-born, after a shorter interval.
</p>
<p>So much for the mother who usually recovers without much trouble.
</p>
<p>The <i>Newborn Infant</i><span id="xd31e1935"></span> is, to say the least of it curiously treated.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb99">[<a href="#pb99">99</a>]</span></p>
<p>Dr. <span class="corr" id="xd31e1940" title="Source: Cassilis">Casalis</span> in recording the birth of 490 Basuto Children, states that of these 160 die in infancy,
and one is not surprised when one considers the trying ordeals of their first few
days of life.
</p>
<p>No sooner is the baby born than the points of its fingers are bled for luck. The infant
is then held in the smoke of a slow fire of aromatic woods till it sneezes or coughs
to show that it is not bewitched. Then commence its ablutions. It is first thoroughly
rubbed all over with a solution of cowdung and then rubbed clean as possible and rolled
in the skin of a goat or sheep recently killed.
</p>
<p>Then commences a course of treatment that is in violation of all laws of nature and
propriety.
</p>
<p>Instead of the infant being allowed to use the mother’s milk “amasabele,” they give
it sour curdled milk (a sort of koumiss or calabash milk) from the cow, the same as
that used by adults. This they force down the throat of the poor little mortal by
blowing it into its mouth and compelling it to swallow. This is continued for three
days, and as a result the bowels become much distended and bowel complaint, often
ending in death, frequently results.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb100">[<a href="#pb100">100</a>]</span></p>
<p>They do this as they believe that the new “Amasebele” new mother’s milk would cake
in the stomach, corrode it, and cause premature decay.
</p>
<p>So that if a child be sickly the doctor often ascribes it to the child having been
fed on <span class="corr" id="xd31e1951" title="Source: mothers">mothers’</span> milk too early, which must be purged away by a course of medicine.
</p>
<p>At the end of three days the infant is allowed to take the amasebele or breast milk.
During these three days if necessary, the breasts are milked by hand.
</p>
<p>The Kaffir, not content with the above extraordinary treatment is in the habit of
administering drugs to the newborn infant.
</p>
<p>Thus on the day of its birth as a purgative, an infusion made by steeping in cold
water the tubers of the U-jyane (Chlorophyton comosum) is administered. This is a
common infantile aperient but when it is not obtainable, a paste of the leaves or
an infusion of the leaves of the U-sikiki (Salvia scabia) is administered for the
same purpose.
</p>
<p>The Zulus have some curious practises, with regard to children.
</p>
<p>At the age of about ten days the first “charm” is worked. It consists of partly burying
the infant at some spot near where lightning has <span class="pageNum" id="pb101">[<a href="#pb101">101</a>]</span>been known to strike. The hole need not be more than a few inches deep. The mother
places her naked infant in the hole, when the Isanuse chewing some medicine roots,
squirts it over the child, muttering an incantation as he does so.
</p>
<p>The child is then taken up by the father, who is usually present, and handed to the
mother. When the ceremony is over, on leaving the spot, no one dare look back, lest
the efficacy of the charm be spoiled. This operation is supposed to instil courage
into the unwitting heart of the little one; such courage, that even when lightning,
the most fearful of all Silos (beasts) is flashing on every side, and the thunder
roars as if the very earth would burst, he or she may not momentarily close an eye.
</p>
<p>The temporary burying of a child at a later age is thought to be a deterrent of diseases
more especially of fevers and colds.
</p>
<p>Mothers of children take their little ones, of any age up to five or six years, early
in the morning some little distance from home, and dig holes in which each child is
placed separately, and into which earth is thrown until the child can only move its
arms and <span class="pageNum" id="pb102">[<a href="#pb102">102</a>]</span>head, the body being in an upright position. The mothers then walk away, singing songs
and behold them from afar, when they return and release them.
</p>
<p>Another charm to prevent sickness is one which is sometimes called “Umtshopi.”
</p>
<p>Young maidens are here the performers. When “Umtshopi” is to be played, these maids
rise early in the morning and go to some brook or riverside where grows, a kind of
long, broad leaved rush, which they pull, and fashion into a fantastic kind of dress,
thus:—
</p>
<p>A rope is plaited sufficient to go round her waist, on this she works the reeds, so
as, to form a fringe or kind of kilt which will touch the ground when she moves. Another
is made to fasten round the chest under the arms, and a third thickly worked is worn
round the neck so as to conceal the arms and bust. A hat is then made in the same
manner, only the rushes are burned so as to stand up, thus giving the girl in this
green costume, the appearance of a moving bunch of grasses.
</p>
<p>Each girl being thus arrayed, they set out on a round of calls to the kraals of the
neighbourhood. Each chants a weird song, dancing, gyrating in a most fantastic manner,
<span class="pageNum" id="pb103">[<a href="#pb103">103</a>]</span>frequently increasing the effect of their grotesque appearance by wild whoops and
unearthly yells, until the smaller children begin to scream of sheer fright; for now
the mothers forcibly lay down on the ground all the younger ones, who cannot be persuaded
to do so, and an Umtonjane jumps over each one, from the tiny mite just learning to
crawl, to urchins of from twelve to fourteen years of age.
</p>
<p>After all the little ones of the kraal have been “jumped” the performers go off and
kindling a fire, burn their “Umtshopi,” a process of some difficulty and duration
owing to the greeness of the reeds. Any garment or ornament which a girl may happen
to wear while playing “Umtshopi” must be burnt, otherwise the efficacy of the charm
is quite destroyed.
</p>
<p>Among the charms practiced to prevent sickness from visiting a kraal is the “Umkuba”
or custom of the girls herding the cattle for a day. No special season of the year
is chosen for this custom. It is merely enacted when diseases are known to be prevalent.
On such an occasion, all the girls and unmarried women of a kraal rise early in the
morning, dress themselves entirely in their brothers’ <span class="pageNum" id="pb104">[<a href="#pb104">104</a>]</span>or men’s skins, and taking their “knobkerries” and sticks, open the cattle pen or
kraal, and drive the cattle away from the vicinity of the homestead, none of these
soidisant herds returning home until sunset, when they bring the cattle back. No one
of the opposite sex dares go near the girls on this day, or speak to them.
</p>
<p>Seriously <i>deformed children</i> are left in the open veldt with the hope that the spirits, who bewitched them will
relent and either cure them or take them away. Usually carnivora manage the latter
alternative.
</p>
<p>The method of doctoring children though curious is on the whole rational.
</p>
<p>When the child is sick, emetics or purgatives are used. If the former, the usual way
of laying the child on its back and holding its nose is adopted. If the latter, a
decoction is prepared, a short piece of small reed is obtained. The mother takes the
liquor into her mouth and inserting one end of the reed into the child’s fundament,
blows the mixture into the bowels giving the picanini what she thinks sufficient.
</p>
<p><i>The Placenta</i> is burned, with the lochia mixed with cowdung, and as far as I can find out there
is no superstition attached to its <span class="pageNum" id="pb105">[<a href="#pb105">105</a>]</span>disposal such as exists in the Highlands of Scotland and in Ireland. The infant is
first rolled in a fresh goat skin and no special treatment of the navel adopted.
</p>
<p><i>Mother’s Milk.</i> Deficiency is almost unknown, but a foster mother is usually ready to supply the
needful in such a case.
</p>
<p>When the infant dies, or is still-born, the breasts are emptied by the mother or an
older child and allowed to dry up as soon as possible. No herbs are used specially
for that purpose<span class="corr" id="xd31e1998" title="Source: ,">.</span>
</p>
<p><i>Pregnancies.</i> Dr. <span class="corr" id="xd31e2004" title="Source: Cassalis">Casalis</span> gives some useful statistics on this subject amongst the Basutos.
</p>
<p>100 women, chosen hap-hazard, had 490 children, 215 boys, 275 girls, of which 330
were alive and 160 dead.
</p>
<p>Of the 100 women, 30 had from 8–9 children; 62 had from 3–6; and 7 from 1–2.
</p>
<p>Six had twins, and only one was sterile, but as many as 45 had aborted at one time
or another during her child-bearing period. And he remarks “The relative frequency
of girls to boys is not abnormal; nor is the number of pregnancies unusually large,
in fact one would <span class="pageNum" id="pb106">[<a href="#pb106">106</a>]</span>expect a larger amongst savages, were it not for the fact that here a mother suckles
her babe for two years, and so usually avoids pregnancy for that period. The Sesuto
have a proverb, <span class="corr" id="xd31e2013" title="Source: “">‘</span>Many babes spoil the womb.<span class="corr" id="xd31e2016" title="Not in source">’</span>”
</p>
<p><i>Sterility</i>, is extremely rare and a great disgrace to Mosuto woman, who will do anything rather
than be considered sterile.
</p>
<p>The general practice of Kaffir tribes is to send the sterile wife back to her father
if she prove sterile after a fair trial; and to demand back the “lobola” <i>i.e.</i> her cost price.
</p>
<p><i>Twins</i> are not looked upon with favour although if they be females they are welcomed.
</p>
<p>In this connection, one must remember that the female is the labourer, and when she
marries, her father receives several head of cattle as “lobola,” or purchase price
of his daughter: hence their welcome.
</p>
<p><i>Miscarriages</i> are mostly attributed to witchcraft, but the sufferers therefrom are sometimes treated
medicinally.
</p>
<p><i>a.</i> The Um-kwinti (Gazania pinnata) is drunk in infusion of all its parts.
</p>
<p><i>b.</i> The Isi-kolokoto (<span class="corr" id="xd31e2039" title="Source: Sanseviera">Sansevieria</span> thyrsiflora) an infusion of the root being used.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb107">[<a href="#pb107">107</a>]</span></p>
<p><i>c.</i> The In-gcelwane (Bulbine latifolia) of which a decoction of the root and stalk is
taken.
</p>
<p><i>Menstruation.</i> The first arrival of this, the average age being 14 years, is made the occasion of
great ceremonies, which vary, however, greatly in different tribes, thus:—Amongst
the Sesutos, the maiden is sent to the Native school (kept for the purpose by a woman),
and turned in what is known as a “Bale.” Much difficulty is experienced in finding
out what exactly takes place; but from what one gathers, there is no removal of parts,
as in circumcision in the male. The result of the treatment is that the labia minora
are considerably elongated, sometimes very much so, and the female thus converted
into an animal of lust and desire. It is notorious that the Basuto women are excessively
immoral. According to them adultery is not an immoral act, unless there has been complete
possession.
</p>
<p>Ho fuba in Sesuto (adultery) means to have complete intercourse, and if followed by
conception is punished usually by fining. A few head of cattle or less, clearing the
culprit even if she be a wife.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb108">[<a href="#pb108">108</a>]</span></p>
<p>Papali (play), however, is an innocent flirt, and here the elongated labia minora
comes into use.
</p>
<p>An old Basuto once said “Were it not for this custom all our woman would repeatedly
become pregnant, and thus spoil their children.”
</p>
<p>Chiefs frequently lend their wives to their headmen, that they may “raise children
to their kraal.”
</p>
<p>Among the Zulus and most of the other Bantu tribes the custom is different.
</p>
<p>The maid is confined with others in a separate hut. She has her own mat to lie on,
made of a peculiar kind of grass called “Nxopo,” her own cooking pot and eating utensils.
Only her nearest female relatives are allowed to approach. She never touches flesh
with her hands, using for this purpose a forked stick, and she never uses milk.
</p>
<p>(This practice of never using milk at menstrual periods is almost universal throughout
the Bantu races and most strictly adhered to. I cannot find out any stated reason
for it.)
</p>
<p>She is not allowed to go near the father’s hut, nor to wander near the kraals of the
calves or cattle, or the other huts.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb109">[<a href="#pb109">109</a>]</span></p>
<p>A special beast is killed for her, and the first cut, viz<span class="corr" id="xd31e2064" title="Not in source">.</span>:—A slice from between the right shoulder and the ribs is reserved for her use. No
one is allowed to use the meat before her share is removed.
</p>
<p>On the tenth day she covers up her face and goes to her home, <span class="corr" id="xd31e2068" title="Source: preceeded">preceded</span> by her nurse<span class="corr" id="xd31e2071" title="Source: ,">.</span> Sour milk (a sort of Koumis) is poured out for her. She drinks some, gargles her
throat and spits it out on to some dry cowdung.
</p>
<p>Her nurse follows suit and then runs out, calling out “So and so has drunk milk, so
and so has drunk milk.”
</p>
<p>The second stage, that of rejoicing and, sad to relate, general immorality then commences.
The friends are called together and the girls now “Intonyani,” dress themselves in
fantastic fashion in reeds, go through wild dancing with much feasting and dancing
and excitement. Then follow orgies impossible in civilization. The old people go to
their huts, content to leave these newly fledged maidens and the youths of the gathering
to spend the night together. Free love becomes the order of the day. Complete connection
is not supposed to take place, and should a girl conceive as a result, <span class="pageNum" id="pb110">[<a href="#pb110">110</a>]</span>the reputed father may be forced to marry her, and pay a fair premium “lobola” to
the father. This is not, however, essential, a fine often being accepted.
</p>
<p>During the few days of this “Intonyane” festival the “Intonyanis” go about from kraal
to kraal. It is now the custom of the mothers to lay their scared infants on the ground
for the girls to jump over them, thus performing “Umtshopi” <i>i.e.</i> charming away sickness.
</p>
<p>After their ceremonies all the articles including dress, hut, fork, mat, &amp;c., &amp;c.,
of the “Intonyane” used during the ceremony must be burned.
</p>
<p><i>Circumcision</i> “Ubukweta” is universally practised amongst the Bantus. Its origin is lost in antiquity,
and it is held by many as proof that the Bantu is the <span class="corr" id="xd31e2088" title="Source: decendant">descendant</span> of peoples, who emigrated from central Asia and are allied to the Jewish nations.
</p>
<p>This rite is performed on the boys at puberty, and is partly civil, in that it introduces
boys to the rights of manhood; and partly religious in that it imposes on them the
responsibility of <span class="pageNum" id="pb111">[<a href="#pb111">111</a>]</span>conforming to all the rights and ceremonies of their superstition.
</p>
<p>It is performed by one of the old men of the tribe by cutting. The instrument used
being by no means sharp; but the wish to be, or appear a man, prevents signs of suffering.
The hemorrhage is stopped by application of <span class="corr" id="xd31e2097" title="Source: astringment">astringent</span> juices mixed with clay; or in some tribes by winding from the point of the glans
up round the penis a long strip of pliable goat skin, which article is afterwards
much valued and carefully preserved.
</p>
<p>A number of youths from the same kraal are done at the same time, and during the healing
process are set apart from their fellows in a locality some distance from the kraals,
where they must provide for themselves in every way. They are then called “Abakweta”
and keep many restrictions and observances, which I do not propose to describe here,
suffice it to say that when the soreness passes off, they are allowed unlimited licence,
and as a consequence the rite has very much degenerated into an unthinkably immoral
custom. Free love with the Abakweta not being considered improper amongst the young
women and “Intonyane.”

their “Amagqira,” possess no mean amount of knowledge of disease and its treatment,
and their extensive use of herbs show in an astonishing degree, the valuable information
which the tribes possess of the therapeutic actions and uses of the vegetable kingdom
as it exists in those parts of the country which they inhabit.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
